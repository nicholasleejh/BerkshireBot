Š When the partnership I ran took control of Berkshire in 1965, I could never have dreamed that a year in whichwehadagainof$24.1billionwouldbesubpar,intermsofthecomparisonwepresentonthefacing page. But subpar it was. For the ninth time in 48 years, Berkshire’s percentage increase in book value was less than the S&P’s percentage gain (a calculation that includes dividends as well as price appreciation). In eight of those nine years, it should be noted, the S&Phad a gain of 15% or more. We dobetter whenthe windisinourface. Todate,we’veneverhadafive-yearperiodofunderperformance,havingmanaged43timestosurpassthe S&P over such a stretch. (The record is on page 103.) But the S&P has now had gains in each of the last four years, outpacing us over that period. If the market continues to advance in 2013, our streak of five- yearwinswillend. One thing of which you can be certain: Whatever Berkshire’s results, my partner Charlie Munger, the company’s Vice Chairman, and I will not change yardsticks. It’s our job to increase intrinsic business value–forwhichweusebookvalueasasignificantlyunderstatedproxy–atafasterratethanthemarket gains of the S&P.If wedoso, Berkshire’s share price, though unpredictable from year toyear,willitself outpacethe S&Povertime.Ifwefail,however,ourmanagementwillbringnovaluetoourinvestors,who themselvescanearn S&Preturnsbybuyingalow-costindexfund.

We couldn’t be in better company. Jorge Paulo is a long-time friend of mine and an extraordinary manager. His group and Berkshire will each contribute about $4 billion for common equity in the holding company. Berkshire will also invest $8 billion in preferred shares that pay a 9% dividend. The preferred has two other features that materially increase its value: at some point it will be redeemed at a significant premium price and the preferred also comes with warrants permitting us to buy 5% of the holding company’scommonstockforanominalsum. Our total investment of about $12 billion soaks up much of what Berkshire earned last year.

Nowtosomegoodnewsfrom2012: Š Lastyear Itoldyouthat BNSF,Iscar,Lubrizol,Marmon Groupand Mid American Energy–ourfivemost profitable non-insurance companies – were likely to earn more than $10 billion pre-tax in 2012. They delivered. Despite tepid U.S. growth and weakening economies throughout much of the world, our “powerhousefive”hadaggregateearningsof$10.1billion,about$600millionmorethanin2011. Ofthisgroup,only Mid American,thenearning$393millionpre-tax,wasownedby Berkshireeightyears ago. Subsequently, we purchased another three of the five on an all-cash basis. In acquiring the fifth, BNSF, we paid about 70% of the cost in cash, and for the remainder, issued shares that increased the amount outstanding by 6.1%. Consequently, the $9.7 billion gain in annual earnings delivered Berkshire bythefivecompanieshasbeenaccompaniedbyonlyminordilution.Thatsatisfiesourgoalofnotsimply growing,butratherincreasingper-shareresults.

When Icountmyblessings,Icount GEICOtwice. Š Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, our new investment managers, have proved to be smart, models of integrity, helpful to Berkshire in many ways beyond portfolio management, and a perfect cultural fit.

Todd and Ted are young and will be around to manage Berkshire’s massive portfolio long after Charlie and I have left the scene. You can rest easy when they takeover. Š Berkshire’s yearend employment totaled a record 288,462 (see page 106 for details), up 17,604 from last year.Ourheadquarterscrew,however,remainedunchangedat24.Nosensegoingcrazy. Š Berkshire’s“Big Four”investments–American Express,Coca-Cola,IBMand Wells Fargo–allhadgood years. Our ownership interest in each of these companies increased during the year. We purchased additionalsharesof Wells Fargo(ourownershipnowis8.7%versus7.6%atyearend2011)and IBM(6.0% versus 5.5%). Meanwhile, stock repurchases at Coca-Cola and American Express raised our percentage ownership. Our equity in Coca-Cola grew from 8.8% to 8.9% and our interest at American Express from 13.0%to13.7%. Berkshire’s ownership interest in all four companies is likely to increase in the future. Mae West had it right:“Toomuchofagoodthingcanbewonderful.” The four companies possess marvelous businesses and are run by managers who are both talented and shareholder-oriented. At Berkshire we much prefer owning a non-controlling but substantial portion of a wonderful business to owning 100% of a so-so business. Our flexibility in capital allocation gives us a significantadvantageovercompaniesthatlimitthemselvesonlytoacquisitionstheycanoperate. Goingbyouryearendsharecount,ourportionofthe“Big Four’s”2012earningsamountedto$3.9billion. Intheearnings wereporttoyou,however,weincludeonlythedividendswereceive–about$1.1billion. Butmake nomistake: The $2.8billion of earnings wedonot report iseverybitasvaluable tousaswhat werecord. The earnings that the four companies retain are often used for repurchases – which enhance our share of futureearnings–andalsoforfundingbusinessopportunitiesthatareusuallyadvantageous.Overtimewe expect substantially greater earnings from these four investees. If we are correct, dividends to Berkshire will increase and, even more important, so will our unrealized capital gains (which, for the four, totaled $26.7billionatyearend). Š There was alotofhand-wringinglastyearamong CEOswhocried“uncertainty”whenfacedwithcapital- allocation decisions (despite many of their businesses having enjoyed record levels of both earnings and cash). At Berkshire, we didn’t share their fears, instead spending a record $9.8 billion on plant and equipment in 2012, about 88% of it in the United States. That’s 19% more than we spent in 2011, our previous high. Charlie and I love investing large sums in worthwhile projects, whatever the pundits are saying.Weinsteadheedthewordsfrom Gary Allan’snewcountrysong,“Every Storm Runs Outof Rain.” Wewillkeepourfoottothefloorandwillalmostcertainlysetstillanotherrecordforcapitalexpenditures in2013.Opportunitiesaboundin America.

We will also try to maximize results for you by rarely, if ever,issuing Berkshireshares. Those building blocks rest ona rock-solid foundation. Acentury hence, BNSFand Mid American Energy willcontinuetoplaymajorrolesinthe Americaneconomy.Insurance,moreover,willalwaysbeessentialforboth businesses and individuals – and no company brings greater resources to that arena than Berkshire. As we view theseandotherstrengths,Charlieand Ilikeyourcompany’sprospects. Intrinsic Business Value Asmuchas Charlieand Italkaboutintrinsicbusinessvalue,wecannottellyoupreciselywhatthatnumber is for Berkshire shares (or, for that matter, any other stock). In our 2010 annual report, however, we laid out the three elements – one of which was qualitative – that we believe are the keys to a sensible estimate of Berkshire’s intrinsicvalue.Thatdiscussionisreproducedinfullonpages104-105. Here is an update of the two quantitative factors: In 2012 our per-share investments increased 15.7% to $113,786, and our per-share pre-tax earnings from businesses other than insurance and investments also increased 15.7%to$8,085. Since 1970, our per-share investments have increased at a rate of 19.4% compounded annually, and our per-share earnings figure has grownata20.8%clip.Itisnocoincidence thattheprice of Berkshire stockoverthe 42-year period has increased at a rate very similar to that of our two measures of value. Charlie and I like to see gainsinbothareas,butourstrongemphasiswillalwaysbeonbuildingoperatingearnings.   Now, let’s examine the four major sectors of our operations. Each has vastly different balance sheet and income characteristics from the others. Lumping them together therefore impedes analysis. So we’ll present them asfourseparatebusinesses,whichishow Charlieand Iviewthem. Insurance Let’s look first at insurance, Berkshire’s core operation and the engine that has propelled our expansion overtheyears. Property-casualty (“P/C”) insurers receive premiums upfront and pay claims later. In extreme cases, such as those arising from certain workers’ compensation accidents, payments can stretch over decades. This collect- now, pay-later model leaves us holding large sums – money we call “float” – that will eventually go to others. Meanwhile,wegettoinvestthisfloatfor Berkshire’sbenefit.Thoughindividualpoliciesandclaimscomeandgo, the amount of float we hold remains quite stable in relation to premium volume. Consequently, as our business grows,sodoesourfloat.Andhowwehavegrown,asthefollowingtableshows: Year Float(in$millions) 1970 $ 39 1980 237 1990 1,632 2000 27,871 2010 65,832 2012 73,125 Lastyear Itoldyouthat ourfloat waslikely tolevel offorevendecline abitinthefuture.Ourinsurance CEOssetouttoprovemewronganddid,increasing floatlastyearby$2.5billion.Inowexpectafurtherincrease in2013.Butfurther gainswillbetoughtoachieve.Ontheplusside,GEICO’sfloatwillalmostcertainly grow.In National Indemnity’s reinsurance division, however, we have a number of run-off contracts whose float drifts downward. If we do experience a decline in float at some future time, it will be very gradual – at the outside no morethan2%inanyyear. If our premiums exceed the total of our expenses and eventual losses, we register an underwriting profit thataddstotheinvestmentincomeourfloatproduces.Whensuchaprofitisearned,weenjoytheuseoffreemoney –and,betteryet,getpaidforholdingit.That’slikeyourtakingoutaloanandhavingthebankpayyouinterest. Unfortunately,thewishofallinsurerstoachievethishappyresultcreatesintensecompetition,sovigorous in most years that it causes the P/C industry as a whole to operate at a significant underwriting loss. This loss, in effect,iswhattheindustrypaystoholditsfloat.Forexample,State Farm,byfarthecountry’slargestinsureranda well-managed company besides, incurred an underwriting loss in eight of the eleven years ending in 2011. (Their financialsfor2012arenotyetavailable.)Therearealotofwaystolosemoneyininsurance,andtheindustrynever ceasessearchingfornewones. As noted in the first section of this report, we have now operated at an underwriting profit for ten consecutive years, our pre-tax gain for the period having totaled $18.6 billion. Looking ahead, I believe we will continuetounderwriteprofitablyinmostyears.Ifwedo,ourfloatwillbebetterthanfreemoney. So how does our attractive float affect the calculations of intrinsic value? When Berkshire’s book value is calculated, the full amount of our float is deducted as a liability, just as if we had to pay it out tomorrow and were unable to replenish it. But that’s an incorrect way to look at float, which should instead be viewed as a revolving fund.Iffloatisbothcostlessandlong-enduring,which Ibelieve Berkshire’swillbe,thetruevalueofthisliabilityis dramaticallylessthantheaccountingliability. Apartialoffsettothisoverstatedliabilityis$15.5billionof“goodwill”thatisattributabletoourinsurance companiesandincludedinbookvalueasanasset.Ineffect,thisgoodwillrepresentsthepricewepaidforthefloat- generating capabilities of our insurance operations. The cost of the goodwill, however, has no bearing on its true value. For example, if an insurance business sustains large and prolonged underwriting losses, any goodwill asset carriedonthebooksshouldbedeemedvalueless,whateveritsoriginalcost. Fortunately,that’snotthecaseat Berkshire.Charlieand Ibelievethetrueeconomicvalueofourinsurance goodwill–whatwewouldhappilypaytopurchaseaninsuranceoperationproducingfloatofsimilarquality–tobe far in excess of its historic carrying value. The value of our float is one reason – a huge reason – why we believe Berkshire’sintrinsicbusinessvaluesubstantiallyexceedsitsbookvalue. Letmeemphasizeonceagainthatcost-freefloatisnotanoutcometobeexpectedforthe P/Cindustryasa whole:Thereisverylittle“Berkshire-quality”floatexistingintheinsuranceworld.In37ofthe45yearsendingin 2011, the industry’s premiums have been inadequate to cover claims plus expenses. Consequently, the industry’s overall return on tangible equity has for many decades fallen far short of the average return realized by American industry,asorryperformancealmostcertaintocontinue. A further unpleasant reality adds to the industry’s dim prospects: Insurance earnings are now benefitting from “legacy” bond portfolios that deliver much higher yields than will be available when funds are reinvested duringthenextfewyears–andperhapsformanyyearsbeyondthat.Today’sbondportfoliosare,ineffect,wasting assets.Earningsofinsurerswillbehurtinasignificantwayasbondsmatureandarerolledover.   Berkshire’s outstanding economics exist only because we have some terrific managers running some extraordinaryinsuranceoperations.Letmetellyouaboutthemajorunits. Firstbyfloatsizeisthe Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group,runby Ajit Jain.Ajitinsuresrisksthatno one else has the desire or the capital to take on. His operation combines capacity, speed, decisiveness and, most important, brains in a manner unique in the insurance business. Yet he never exposes Berkshire to risks that are inappropriate in relation to our resources. Indeed, we are far more conservative in avoiding risk than most large insurers.Forexample,iftheinsuranceindustryshouldexperiencea$250billionlossfromsomemega-catastrophe –alossabouttripleanythingithaseverexperienced–Berkshireasawholewouldlikelyrecordasignificantprofit for the year because it has so many streams of earnings. All other major insurers and reinsurers would meanwhile befarinthered,withsomefacinginsolvency. From a standing start in 1985, Ajit has created an insurance business with float of $35 billion and a significant cumulative underwriting profit, afeat thatnootherinsurance CEOhascomeclosetomatching.Hehas thus added a great many billions of dollars to the value of Berkshire. If you meet Ajit at the annual meeting, bow deeply.   Wehaveanotherreinsurancepowerhousein General Re,managedby Tad Montross. At bottom, a sound insurance operation needs to adhere to four disciplines. It must (1) understand all exposuresthatmightcauseapolicytoincurlosses;(2)conservativelyassessthelikelihoodofanyexposureactually causing a loss and the probable cost if it does; (3) set a premium that, on average, will deliver a profit after both prospective loss costs and operating expenses are covered; and (4) be willing to walk away if the appropriate premiumcan’tbeobtained.

Finally,thereis GEICO,theinsureronwhich Icutmyteeth62yearsago.GEICOisrunby Tony Nicely, whojoinedthecompanyat18andcompleted51yearsofservicein2012. I rub my eyes when I look at what Tony has accomplished. Last year, it should be noted, his record was considerably better thanisindicated by GEICO’s GAAPunderwriting profit of$680million.Becauseofachange in accounting rules at the beginning of the year, we recorded a charge to GEICO’s underwriting earnings of $410million.Thisitemhadnothingtodowith2012’soperatingresults,changingneithercash,revenues,expenses nor taxes. In effect, the writedown simply widened the already huge difference between GEICO’s intrinsic value andthevalueatwhichwecarryitonourbooks. GEICO earned its underwriting profit, moreover, despite the company suffering its largest single loss in history. The cause was Hurricane Sandy, which cost GEICO more than three times the loss it sustained from Katrina, the previous record-holder. We insured 46,906 vehicles that were destroyed or damaged in the storm, a staggeringnumberreflecting GEICO’sleadingmarketshareinthe New Yorkmetropolitanarea. Last year GEICO enjoyed a meaningful increase in both the renewal rate for existing policyholders (“persistency”) and in the percentage of rate quotations that resulted in sales (“closures”). Big dollars ride on those two factors: A sustained gain in persistency of a bare one percentage point increases intrinsic value by more than $1 billion. GEICO’s gains in 2012 offer dramatic proof that when people check the company’s prices, they usually findtheycansaveimportantsums.(Giveusatryat1-800-847-7536or GEICO.com.Besuretomentionthatyouarea shareholder;thatfactwillusuallyresultinadiscount.)

Regulated,Capital-Intensive Businesses We have two major operations, BNSF and Mid American Energy, that have important common characteristics distinguishing them from our other businesses. Consequently, we assign them their own section in thisletterandsplitouttheircombinedfinancialstatisticsinour GAAPbalancesheetandincomestatement. A key characteristic of both companies is their huge investment in very long-lived, regulated assets, with these partially funded by large amounts of long-term debt that is not guaranteed by Berkshire. Our credit is in fact not needed because each business has earning power that even under terrible conditions amply covers its interest requirements. In last year’s tepid economy, for example, BNSF’s interest coverage was 9.6x. (Our definition of coverage is pre-tax earnings/interest, not EBITDA/interest, a commonly-used measure we view as deeply flawed.) At Mid American, meanwhile, two key factors ensure its ability to service debt under all circumstances: the company’srecession-resistantearnings,whichresultfromourexclusivelyofferinganessentialservice,anditsgreat diversityofearningsstreams,whichshielditfrombeingseriouslyharmedbyanysingleregulatorybody.

Whatintheworld is Home Services, a real estate brokerage operation, doing in a section entitled “Regulated, Capital-Intensive Businesses?” Well, its ownership came with Mid American when we bought control of that company in 2000. At that time, I focused on Mid American’s utility operations and barely noticed Home Services, which then owned only a fewrealestatebrokeragecompanies. Since then, however, the company has regularly added residential brokers – three in 2012 – and now has about 16,000 agents in a string of major U.S. cities. (Our real estate brokerage companies are listed on page 107.) In2012,ouragentsparticipatedin$42billionofhomesales,up33%from2011.

Our income and expense data conforming to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) is on page 29. In contrast, the operating expense figures above are non-GAAP. In particular, they exclude some purchase-accounting items, primarily the amortization of certain intangible assets. We present the data in this mannerbecause Charlieand Ibelievetheadjustednumbersmoreaccuratelyreflecttherealexpensesandprofitsof thebusinessesaggregatedinthetable. I won’t explain all of the adjustments – some are small and arcane – but serious investors should understand the disparate nature of intangible assets: Some truly deplete over time while others never lose value. With software, for example, amortization charges are very real expenses. Charges against other intangibles such as theamortizationofcustomerrelationships,however,arisethroughpurchase-accountingrulesandareclearlynotreal expenses. GAAP accounting draws no distinction between the two types of charges. Both, that is, are recorded as expenseswhencalculatingearnings–eventhoughfromaninvestor’sviewpointtheycouldnotbemoredifferent.

This difference has become significant becauseofthemanyacquisitionswehavemade. “Non-real” amortization expense also looms large at some of our major investees.

Andthatendstoday’saccountinglecture.Whyisnooneshouting“More,more?”   The crowd of companies in this section sell products ranging from lollipops to jet airplanes. Some of the businesses enjoy terrific economics, measured by earnings on unleveraged net tangible assets that run from 25% after-tax to more than 100%. Others produce goodreturns in the area of 12-20%.Afew,however,haveverypoor returns,aresultofsomeseriousmistakes Imadeinmyjobofcapitalallocation. More than 50 years ago, Charlie told me that it was far better to buy a wonderful business at a fair price than to buy a fair business at a wonderful price. Despite the compelling logic of his position, I have sometimes revertedtomyoldhabitofbargain-hunting,withresultsrangingfromtolerabletoterrible.Fortunately,mymistakes have usually occurred when I made smaller purchases. Our large acquisitions have generally worked out well and, inafewcases,morethanwell. Viewed as a single entity, therefore, the companies in this group are an excellent business. They employ $22.6billionofnettangibleassetsand,onthatbase,earned16.3%after-tax. Of course, a business with terrific economics can be a bad investment if the price paid is excessive. We have paid substantialpremiumstonet tangible assets for mostof our businesses, a cost thatisreflected inthelarge figure we show for intangible assets.

The cost of our recent 10% purchase implies a $12.6 billion value for the 90% of Marmon we now own. Our balance-sheet carrying value for the 90%, however, is $8 billion. Charlie and I believe our current purchase represents excellent value. If we are correct, our Marmon holding is worth at least $4.6 billion more than its carryingvalue.

We Buy Some Newspapers...Newspapers? During the past fifteen months, we acquired 28 daily newspapers at a cost of $344 million. This may puzzle you for two reasons. First, I have long told you in these letters and at our annual meetings that the circulation, advertising and profits of the newspaper industry overall are certain to decline. That prediction still holds. Second, the properties we purchased fell far short of meeting our oft-stated size requirements for acquisitions. Wecanaddressthesecondpointeasily.Charlieand Ilovenewspapersand,iftheireconomicsmakesense, willbuythemevenwhentheyfallfarshortofthesizethresholdwewouldrequireforthepurchaseof,say,awidget company.Addressingthefirstpointrequiresmetoprovideamoreelaborateexplanation,includingsomehistory. News,toputitsimply,iswhatpeopledon’tknowthattheywanttoknow.Andpeoplewillseektheirnews – what’s important to them – from whatever sources provide the best combination of immediacy, ease of access, reliability, comprehensiveness and low cost. The relative importance of these factors varies with the nature of the newsandthepersonwantingit. Beforetelevisionandthe Internet,newspapersweretheprimarysourceforanincrediblevarietyofnews,a fact that made them indispensable to a very high percentage of the population. Whether your interests were international, national, local, sports or financial quotations, your newspaper usually was first to tell you the latest information.Indeed,yourpapercontainedsomuchyouwantedtolearnthatyoureceivedyourmoney’sworth,even if only a small number of its pages spoke to your specific interests. Better yet, advertisers typically paid almost all oftheproduct’scost,andreadersrodetheircoattails. Additionally, the ads themselves delivered information of vital interest to hordes of readers, in effect providing even more “news.” Editors would cringe at the thought, but for many readers learning what jobs or apartmentswereavailable,whatsupermarketswerecarryingwhichweekendspecials,orwhatmovieswereshowing whereandwhenwasfarmoreimportantthantheviewsexpressedontheeditorialpage. In turn, the local paper was indispensable to advertisers. If Sears or Safeway built stores in Omaha, they requireda“megaphone”totellthecity’sresidentswhytheirstoresshouldbevisitedtoday.Indeed,bigdepartment stores and grocers vied to outshout their competition with multi-page spreads, knowing that the goods they advertised wouldfly off the shelves. Withnoothermegaphone remotely comparable tothatofthenewspaper,ads soldthemselves. As long as a newspaper was the only one in its community, its profits were certain to be extraordinary; whether it was managed well or poorly made little difference. (As one Southern publisher famously confessed, “I owemyexaltedpositioninlifetotwogreat Americaninstitutions–nepotismandmonopoly.”) Over the years, almost all cities became one-newspaper towns (or harbored two competing papers that joinedforcestooperateasasingleeconomicunit).Thiscontractionwasinevitablebecausemostpeoplewishedto read and pay for only one paper. When competition existed, the paper that gained a significant lead in circulation almostautomatically receivedthemostads.Thatleftadsdrawingreadersandreadersdrawingads.Thissymbiotic processspelleddoomfortheweakerpaperandbecameknownas“survivalofthefattest.” Now the world has changed. Stock market quotes and the details of national sports events are old news longbeforethepressesbegintoroll.The Internetoffersextensiveinformationaboutbothavailablejobsandhomes. Television bombards viewers with political, national and international news. In one area of interest after another, newspapers have therefore lost their “primacy.” And, as their audiences have fallen, so has advertising. (Revenues from“helpwanted”classifiedads–longahugesourceofincomefornewspapers–haveplungedmorethan90%in thepast12years.) Newspaperscontinuetoreignsupreme,however,inthedeliveryoflocalnews.Ifyouwanttoknowwhat’s goingoninyourtown–whetherthenewsisaboutthemayorortaxesorhighschoolfootball–thereisnosubstitute foralocalnewspaperthatisdoingitsjob.Areader’seyesmayglazeoveraftertheytakeinacoupleofparagraphs about Canadian tariffs or political developments in Pakistan; a story about the reader himself or his neighbors will be read to the end. Wherever there is a pervasive sense of community, a paper thatserves the special informational needsofthatcommunitywillremainindispensabletoasignificantportionofitsresidents. Even a valuable product, however, can self-destruct from a faulty business strategy. Andthat process has been underway during the past decade at almost all papers of size. Publishers – including Berkshire in Buffalo – haveofferedtheirpaperfreeonthe Internetwhilechargingmeaningfulsumsforthephysicalspecimen.Howcould this lead to anything other than a sharp and steady drop in sales of the printed product? Falling circulation, moreover, makes a paper less essential to advertisers. Under these conditions, the “virtuous circle” of the past reverses. The Wall Street Journal went to a pay model early. But the main exemplar for local newspapers is the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, published by Walter Hussman, Jr. Walter also adopted a pay format early, and over the past decade his paper has retained its circulation far better than any other large paper in the country. Despite Walter’s powerful example, it’s only been in the last year or so that other papers, including Berkshire’s, have exploredpayarrangements.Whateverworksbest–andtheanswerisnotyetclear–willbecopiedwidely.   Charlie and I believe that papers delivering comprehensive and reliable information to tightly-bound communities and having a sensible Internet strategy will remain viable for a long time. We do not believe that success will come from cutting either the news content or frequency of publication. Indeed, skimpy news coverage will almost certainly lead to skimpy readership. And the less-than-daily publication that is now being tried in some large towns or cities – while it may improve profits in the short term – seems certain to diminish the papers’ relevance over time. Our goal is to keep our papers loaded with content of interest to our readers and to be paid appropriatelybythosewhofindususeful,whethertheproducttheyviewisintheirhandsoronthe Internet. Our confidence is buttressed by the availability of Terry Kroeger’s outstanding management group at the Omaha World-Herald, a team that has the ability to oversee a large group of papers. The individual papers, however, will be independent in their news coverage and editorial opinions. (I voted for Obama; of our 12 dailies thatendorsedapresidentialcandidate,10optedfor Romney.) Our newspapers are certainly not insulated from the forces that have been driving revenues downward. Still, thesixsmall dailies weownedthroughout 2012hadunchangedrevenues fortheyear,aresult farsuperiorto thatexperiencedbybig-citydailies.Moreover,thetwolargepapersweoperatedthroughouttheyear–The Buffalo News and the Omaha World-Herald – held their revenue loss to 3%, which was also an above-average outcome.

Thispopularityisnoaccident:Credittheeditorsofthosepapers–Margaret Sullivanatthe Newsand Mike Reilly at the World-Herald — for delivering information that has made their publications indispensable to community-interested readers.

Charlie and I, however, still operate under economic principle 11 (detailed on page 99) and will not continue the operation of any business doomed to unending losses.

Withouta Sundaypaper, the Newswas destinedtoloseouttoitsmorningcompetitor,whichhadafatandentrenched Sundayproduct. We therefore began to print a Sunday edition late in 1977.

(He was a key person in gaining that small weekly a Pulitzer Prize in 1973.)

Evenafterwedeployheftyamountsofcapitalinourcurrentoperations,Berkshirewillregularlygeneratea lot of additional cash.

Here our test is simple: Do Charlie and I think we can effect a transaction that is likely to leave our shareholders wealthieronaper-sharebasisthantheywerepriortotheacquisition?

Overall, however, our record is satisfactory,whichmeansthatourshareholdersarefarwealthiertodaythantheywouldbeifthefundsweusedfor acquisitionshadinsteadbeendevotedtosharerepurchasesordividends. But, to use the standard disclaimer, past performance is noguarantee of future results.

Nevertheless,alargedealstilloffersuspossibilitiestoaddmateriallytoper-shareintrinsicvalue.BNSFis a case in point: It is now worth considerably more than our carrying value.

Though large transactionsofthe BNSFkindwillberare,therearestillsomewhalesintheocean. The third use of funds – repurchases – is sensible for a company when its shares sell at a meaningful discount to conservatively calculated intrinsic value. Indeed, disciplined repurchases are the surest way to use funds intelligently: It’s hard to go wrong when you’re buying dollar bills for 80¢ or less. We explained our criteria for repurchases in last year’s report and, if the opportunity presents itself,we will buylarge quantities of our stock.We originally said we would not pay more than 110% of book value, but that proved unrealistic. Therefore, we increasedthelimitto120%in Decemberwhenalargeblockbecameavailableatabout116%ofbookvalue. But never forget: In repurchase decisions, price is all-important. Value is destroyed when purchases are madeaboveintrinsic value.Thedirectors and Ibelievethatcontinuingshareholdersarebenefittedinameaningful waybypurchasesuptoour120%limit. And that brings us to dividends. Here we have to make a few assumptions and use some math. The numberswillrequirecarefulreading,buttheyareessentialtounderstandingthecaseforandagainstdividends.So bearwithme. We’llstartbyassumingthatyouand Iaretheequalownersofabusinesswith$2millionofnetworth.The business earns 12% on tangible net worth – $240,000 – and can reasonably expect to earn the same 12% on reinvested earnings. Furthermore, there are outsiders who always wish to buy into our business at 125% of net worth.Therefore,thevalueofwhatweeachownisnow$1.25million. Youwouldliketohavethetwoofusshareholdersreceiveone-thirdofourcompany’sannualearningsand have two-thirds be reinvested. That plan, you feel, will nicely balance your needs for both current income and capital growth. So you suggest that we pay out $80,000 of current earnings and retain $160,000 to increase the futureearningsofthebusiness.Inthefirstyear,yourdividendwouldbe$40,000,andasearningsgrewandtheone- third payout was maintained, so too would your dividend. In total, dividends and stock value would increase 8% eachyear(12%earnedonnetworthless4%ofnetworthpaidout). Aftertenyearsourcompanywouldhaveanetworthof$4,317,850(theoriginal$2millioncompoundedat 8%) and your dividend in the upcoming year would be $86,357. Each of us would have shares worth $2,698,656 (125% of our half of the company’s net worth). And we would live happily ever after – with dividends and the valueofourstockcontinuingtogrowat8%annually. There is an alternative approach, however, that would leave us even happier. Under this scenario, we wouldleaveallearningsinthecompanyandeachsell3.2%ofoursharesannually.Sincetheshareswouldbesold at 125% of book value, this approach would produce the same $40,000 of cash initially, a sum that would grow annually.Callthisoptionthe“sell-off”approach. Under this “sell-off” scenario, the net worth of our company increases to $6,211,696 after ten years ($2millioncompoundedat12%).Becausewewouldbesellingshareseachyear,ourpercentageownershipwould have declined, and, after ten years, we would each own 36.12% of the business. Even so, your share of the net worth of the company at that time would be $2,243,540. And, remember, every dollar of net worth attributable to eachofuscanbesoldfor$1.25.Therefore,themarketvalueofyourremainingshareswouldbe$2,804,425,about 4%greaterthanthevalueofyoursharesifwehadfollowedthedividendapproach. Moreover, your annual cash receipts from the sell-off policy would now be running 4% more than you would have received under the dividend scenario. Voila! – you would have both more cash to spend annually and morecapitalvalue. Thiscalculation,ofcourse,assumesthatourhypotheticalcompanycanearnanaverageof12%annuallyon net worth and that its shareholders can sell their shares for an average of 125% of book value. To that point, the S&P 500 earns considerably more than 12% on net worth and sells at a price far above 125% of that net worth. Bothassumptionsalsoseemreasonablefor Berkshire,thoughcertainlynotassured. Moreover,ontheplusside,therealsoisapossibilitythattheassumptionswillbeexceeded.Iftheyare,the argumentforthesell-offpolicybecomesevenstronger.Over Berkshire’shistory–admittedlyonethatwon’tcome close to being repeated –the sell-off policywouldhaveproducedresults forshareholders dramatically superior to thedividendpolicy. Aside from the favorable math, there are two further – and important – arguments for a sell-off policy. First,dividendsimposeaspecificcash-outpolicyuponallshareholders.If,say,40%ofearningsisthepolicy,those whowish30%or50%willbethwarted.Our600,000shareholderscoverthewaterfrontintheirdesiresforcash.It is safe to say, however, that a great many of them – perhaps even most of them – are in a net-savings mode and logicallyshouldprefernopaymentatall. Thesell-offalternative,ontheotherhand,letseachshareholdermakehisownchoicebetweencashreceipts and capital build-up. One shareholder can elect to cash out, say, 60% of annual earnings while other shareholders elect 20% or nothing at all. Of course, a shareholder inour dividend-paying scenario could turn around and use his dividendstopurchasemoreshares.Buthewouldtakeabeatingindoingso:Hewouldbothincurtaxesandalsopay a 25% premium to get his dividend reinvested. (Keep remembering, open-market purchases of the stock take place at125%ofbookvalue.) The second disadvantage of the dividend approach is of equal importance: The tax consequences for all taxpaying shareholders areinferior –usually farinferior –tothoseunderthesell-off program.Underthedividend program, all of the cash received byshareholders each year is taxed whereas the sell-off program results in tax on onlythegainportionofthecashreceipts. Let me endthis math exercise – and I canhear youcheering as I put awaythe dentist drill – by usingmy own case to illustrate how a shareholder’s regular disposals of shares can be accompanied by an increased investmentinhisorherbusiness.Forthelastsevenyears,Ihaveannuallygivenawayabout41⁄ 4%ofmy Berkshire shares. Through this process, my original position of 712,497,000 B-equivalent shares (split-adjusted) has decreasedto528,525,623shares.Clearlymyownershippercentageofthecompanyhassignificantlydecreased. Yet my investment in the business has actually increased: The book value of my current interest in Berkshire considerably exceeds the book value attributable to my holdings of seven years ago. (The actual figures are $28.2 billion for 2005 and $40.2 billion for 2012.) In other words, I now have far more money working for me at Berkshire even though my ownership of the company has materially decreased. It’s also true that my share of both Berkshire’sintrinsicbusinessvalueandthecompany’snormalearningpowerisfargreaterthanitwasin2005. Over time, I expect this accretion of value to continue – albeit in a decidedly irregular fashion – even as I now annually give away more than 41⁄ 2% of my shares (the increase having occurred because I’ve recently doubled my lifetimepledgestocertainfoundations).   Above all, dividend policy should always be clear, consistent and rational. A capricious policy will confuseownersanddriveawaywould-beinvestors.Phil Fisherputitwonderfully54yearsagoin Chapter7ofhis Common Stocksand Uncommon Profits,abookthatranksbehindonly The Intelligent Investorandthe1940edition of Security Analysis in the all-time-best list for the serious investor.
