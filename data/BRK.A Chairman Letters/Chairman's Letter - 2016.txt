BERKSHIREHATHAWAYINC. Tothe Shareholdersof Berkshire Hathaway Inc.: Berkshire’s gain in net worth during 2016 was $27.5 billion, which increased the per-share book value ofbothour Class Aand Class Bstockby10.7%.Overthelast 52years(that is,sincepresentmanagementtook over),per-sharebookvaluehasgrownfrom$19to$172,108,arateof19%compoundedannually.* During the first half of those years, Berkshire’s net worth was roughly equal to the number that really counts: the intrinsic value of the business. The similarity of the two figures existed then because most of our resourcesweredeployedinmarketable securities thatwereregularlyrevaluedtotheirquotedprices(lessthetax thatwouldbeincurrediftheyweretobesold).In Wall Streetparlance,ourbalancesheetwastheninverylarge part“markedtomarket.” By the early 1990s, however, our focus was changing to the outright ownership of businesses, a shift that materially diminished the relevance of balance sheet figures. That disconnect occurred because the accountingrules(commonlyreferredtoas“GAAP”)thatapplytocompanieswecontroldifferinimportantways from those used to value marketable securities. Specifically, the accounting for businesses we own requires that the carrying value of “losers” be written down when their failures become apparent. “Winners,” conversely, are neverrevaluedupwards. We’ve experienced both outcomes: As is the case in marriage, business acquisitions often deliver surprises after the“Ido’s.”I’vemadesomedumbpurchases, payingfartoomuchfortheeconomic goodwillof companies we acquired. That later led to goodwill write-offs and to consequent reductions in Berkshire’s book value. We’ve also had some winners among the businesses we’ve purchased – a few of the winners very big – buthavenotwrittenthoseupbyapenny. We have no quarrel with the asymmetrical accounting that applies here. But, over time, it necessarily widens the gap between Berkshire’s intrinsic value and its book value. Today, the large – and growing – unrecorded gains at our winners produce an intrinsic value for Berkshire’s shares that far exceeds their book value. The overage is truly huge in our property/casualty insurance business and significant also in many other operations. Over time, stock prices gravitate toward intrinsic value. That’s what has happened at Berkshire, a fact explaining why the company’s 52-year market-price gain – shown on the facing page – materially exceeds its book-valuegain. *Allper-share figures usedinthisreportapplyto Berkshire’s Ashares.Figuresforthe Bsharesare1/1500thof thoseshownfor A. What We Hopeto Accomplish Charlie Munger, Berkshire’s Vice Chairman and my partner, and I expect Berkshire’s normalized earning power per share to increase every year. Actual earnings, of course, will sometimes decline because of periodic weakness in the U.S. economy. In addition, insurance mega-catastrophes or other industry-specific eventsmayoccasionallyreduceearningsat Berkshire,evenwhenmost Americanbusinessesaredoingwell. It’sourjob,though,toovertimedeliversignificantgrowth,bumpyornot.Afterall,asstewardsofyour capital, Berkshire directors have opted to retain all earnings. Indeed, in both 2015 and 2016 Berkshire ranked first among American businesses in the dollar volume of earnings retained, in each year reinvesting many billionsofdollarsmorethandidtherunner-up.Thosereinvesteddollarsmustearntheirkeep. Some years, the gains in underlying earning power we achieve will be minor; very occasionally, the cash register will ring loud. Charlie and I have no magic plan to add earnings except to dream big and to be prepared mentally and financially to act fast when opportunities present themselves. Every decade or so, dark clouds will fill the economic skies, and they will briefly rain gold. When downpours of that sort occur, it’s imperativethatwerushoutdoorscarryingwashtubs,notteaspoons.Andthatwewilldo. I earlier described our gradual shift from a company obtaining most of its gains from investment activities to one that grows in value by owning businesses. Launching that transition, we took baby steps – making small acquisitions whose impact on Berkshire’s profits was dwarfed by our gains from marketable securities. Despite that cautious approach, I made one particularly egregious error, acquiring Dexter Shoe for $434millionin1993.Dexter’svaluepromptlywenttozero.Thestorygetsworse:Iusedstockforthepurchase, givingthesellers25,203sharesof Berkshirethatatyearend2016wereworthmorethan$6billion. That wreck was followed by three key happenings – two positive, one negative – that set us firmly on our present course. At the beginning of 1996, we acquired the half of GEICO we didn’t already own, a cash transaction that changed our holding from a portfolio investment into a wholly-owned operating business. GEICO,withitsalmostunlimitedpotential,quicklybecamethecenterpiecearoundwhichwebuiltwhat Ibelieve isnowtheworld’spremierproperty/casualtybusiness. Unfortunately, I followed the GEICO purchase by foolishly using Berkshire stock – a boatload of stock – to buy General Reinsurance in late 1998. After some early problems, General Re has become a fine insurance operation that we prize. It was, nevertheless, a terrible mistake on my part to issue 272,200 shares of Berkshire in buying General Re, an act that increased our outstanding shares by a whopping 21.8%. My error caused Berkshire shareholders to give far more than they received (a practice that – despite the Biblical endorsement–isfarfromblessedwhenyouarebuyingbusinesses). Early in 2000, I atoned for that folly by buying 76% (since grown to 90%) of Mid American Energy, a brilliantly-managed utility business that has delivered us many large opportunities to make profitable and socially-useful investments. The Mid American cash purchase – I was learning – firmly launched us on our presentcourseof(1)continuingtobuildourinsuranceoperation;(2)energeticallyacquiringlargeanddiversified non-insurancebusinessesand(3)largelymakingourdealsfrominternally-generatedcash.(Today,Iwouldrather prepforacolonoscopythanissue Berkshireshares.) Ourportfolioofbondsandstocks,de-emphasized thoughitis,hascontinuedinthepost-1998periodto grow and to deliver us hefty capital gains, interest, and dividends. Those portfolio earnings have provided us major help in financing the purchase of businesses. Though unconventional, Berkshire’s two-pronged approach tocapitalallocationgivesusarealedge. Here’s our financial record since 1999, when the redirection of our business began in earnest. During the 18-year period covered, Berkshire’s outstanding shares grew by only 8.3%, with most of the increase occurringwhenwepurchased BNSF.That,I’mhappytosay,wasoneissuanceofstockthatmadegoodsense.

Our expectation is that investment gains will continue to be substantial – though totally random as to timing – and that these will supply significant funds for business purchases. Concurrently, Berkshire’s superb corps of operating CEOs will focus on increasing earnings at the individual businesses they manage, sometimes helping them to grow by making bolt-on acquisitions.

One word sums up our country’s achievements: miraculous. From a standing start 240 years ago – a span of time less than triple my days on earth – Americans have combined human ingenuity, a market system, a tide of talented and ambitious immigrants,andtheruleoflawtodeliverabundancebeyondanydreamsofourforefathers. You need not be an economist to understand how well our system has worked. Just look around you.

Our nation’s wealth remains intact. As Gertrude Stein put it, “Money is always there, but the pocketschange.” Above all, it’s our market system – an economic traffic cop ably directing capital, brains and labor – that has created America’s abundance. This system has also been the primary factor in allocating rewards. Governmentalredirection,throughfederal,stateandlocaltaxation,hasinadditiondeterminedthedistributionof asignificantportionofthebounty.

However our wealth may be divided, the mind-boggling amounts you see around you belong almost exclusively to Americans. Foreigners, of course, own or have claims on a modest portion of our wealth. Those holdings,however,areoflittleimportancetoournationalbalancesheet:Ourcitizensownassetsabroadthatare roughlycomparableinvalue.

But those venturesome pioneers crafted a system that unleashed humanpotential,andtheirsuccessorsbuiltuponit. This economic creation will deliver increasing wealth to our progeny far into the future. Yes, the build-up of wealth will be interrupted for short periods from time to time. It will not, however, be stopped. I’ll repeat what I’ve both said in the past and expect to say in future years: Babies born in America today are the luckiestcropinhistory.   America’s economic achievements have led to staggering profits for stockholders. During the 20th century the Dow-Jones Industrials advanced from 66 to 11,497, a 17,320% capital gain that was materially boosted by steadily increasing dividends. The trend continues: By yearend 2016, the index had advanced a further72%,to19,763.

Meg Mc Connell of the New York Fed aptly described the reality of panics: “We spendalotoftimelookingforsystemicrisk;intruth,however,ittendstofindus.” During such scary periods, you should never forget two things: First, widespread fear is your friend as an investor, because it serves up bargain purchases. Second, personal fear is your enemy. It will also be unwarranted. Investors who avoid high and unnecessary costs and simply sit for an extended period with a collectionoflarge,conservatively-financed Americanbusinesseswillalmostcertainlydowell.

Share Repurchases In the investment world, discussions aboutshare repurchases oftenbecomeheated.But I’dsuggestthat participantsinthisdebatetakeadeepbreath:Assessingthedesirabilityofrepurchasesisn’tthatcomplicated. From the standpointofexitingshareholders,repurchasesarealwaysaplus.Thoughtheday-to-dayimpactof thesepurchasesisusuallyminuscule,it’salwaysbetterforasellertohaveanadditionalbuyerinthemarket. For continuing shareholders, however, repurchases only make sense if the shares are bought at a price belowintrinsicvalue.Whenthatruleisfollowed,theremainingsharesexperienceanimmediategaininintrinsic value. Consider a simple analogy: If there are three equalpartners inabusiness worth$3,000andoneisbought out by the partnership for $900, each of the remaining partners realizes an immediate gain of $50.If the exiting partner is paid $1,100, however, the continuing partners each suffer a loss of $50. The same math applies with corporations and their shareholders. Ergo, the question of whether a repurchase action is value-enhancing or value-destroyingforcontinuingshareholdersisentirelypurchase-pricedependent. It is puzzling, therefore, that corporate repurchase announcements almost never refer to a price above whichrepurchaseswillbeeschewed.Thatcertainlywouldn’tbethecaseifamanagementwasbuyinganoutside business.There,pricewouldalwaysfactorintoabuy-or-passdecision.

It is important to remember that there are two occasions in which repurchases should not take place, even if the company’s shares are underpriced. One is when a business both needs all its available money to protect or expand its own operations and is also uncomfortable adding further debt. Here, the internal need for funds should take priority. This exception assumes, of course, that the business has a decent future awaiting it aftertheneededexpendituresaremade. Thesecondexception,lesscommon,materializeswhenabusinessacquisition(orsomeotherinvestment opportunity) offers far greater value than do the undervalued shares of the potential repurchaser. Long ago, Berkshire itself often had to choose between these alternatives. Atour present size, the issue is far less likely to arise. My suggestion: Before even discussing repurchases, a CEO and his or her Board should stand, join handsandinunisondeclare,“Whatissmartatonepriceisstupidatanother.”   Torecap Berkshire’sownrepurchasepolicy:Iamauthorizedtobuylargeamountsof Berkshiresharesat 120%orlessofbookvaluebecauseour Boardhasconcludedthatpurchasesatthatlevelclearlybringaninstantand material benefit to continuing shareholders. By our estimate, a 120%-of-book price is a significant discount to Berkshire’sintrinsicvalue,aspreadthatisappropriatebecausecalculationsofintrinsicvaluecan’tbeprecise. The authorization given me does not mean that we will “prop” our stock’s price at the 120% ratio. If that level isreached, wewillinstead attempt toblendadesire tomakemeaningful purchases atavalue-creating pricewitharelatedgoalofnotover-influencingthemarket. Todate,repurchasingourshareshasprovedhardtodo.Thatmaywellbebecausewehavebeenclearin describing our repurchase policy and thereby have signaled our view that Berkshire’s intrinsic value is significantlyhigherthan120%ofbookvalue.Ifso,that’sfine.Charlieand Iprefertosee Berkshiresharessellin a fairly narrow range around intrinsic value, neither wishing them to sell at an unwarranted high price – it’s no fun having owners who are disappointed with their purchases – nor one too low. Furthermore, our buying out “partners” at a discount is not a particularly gratifying wayof making money. Still, market circumstances could create asituation inwhichrepurchases wouldbenefit bothcontinuingandexitingshareholders. Ifso,wewillbe readytoact. One final observation for this section: As the subject of repurchases has come to a boil, some people have come close to calling them un-American – characterizing them as corporate misdeeds that divert funds needed for productive endeavors. That simply isn’t the case: Both American corporations and private investors are today awash in funds looking to be sensibly deployed. I’m not aware of any enticing project that in recent yearshasdiedforlackofcapital.(Callusifyouhaveacandidate.) Insurance Let’s now look at Berkshire’s various businesses, starting with our most important sector, insurance. The property/casualty (“P/C”) branch of that industry has been the engine that has propelled our growth since 1967,theyearweacquired National Indemnityanditssistercompany,National Fire&Marine,for$8.6million. Today,National Indemnityisthelargestproperty/casualtycompanyintheworldasmeasuredbynetworth. One reason we were attracted to the P/C business was its financial characteristics: P/C insurers receive premiums upfront and pay claims later. In extreme cases, such as claims arising from exposure to asbestos, payments canstretch overmanydecades.Thiscollect-now,pay-later modelleaves P/Ccompaniesholdinglarge sums –money wecall “float” –that will eventually goto others. Meanwhile, insurers gettoinvest thisfloat for their own benefit. Though individual policies and claims come and go, the amount of float an insurer holds usually remains fairly stable in relation to premium volume. Consequently, as our business grows, so does our float.Andhowithasgrown,asthefollowingtableshows: Year Float(inmillions) 1970 $ 39 1980 237 1990 1,632 2000 27,871 2010 65,832 2016 91,577 We recently wrote a huge policy that increased float to more than $100 billion. Beyond that one-time boost,floatat GEICOandseveralofourspecializedoperationsisalmostcertaintogrowatagoodclip.National Indemnity’s reinsurance division, however, is party to a number of large run-off contracts whosefloat is certain todriftdownward. We may in time experience a decline in float. If so, the decline willbeverygradual –attheoutside no more than 3% in any year. The nature of our insurance contracts is such that we can never be subject to immediate or near-term demands for sums that are of significance to our cash resources. This structure is by design and is a key component in the unequaled financial strength of our insurance companies. It will never be compromised. If our premiums exceed the total of our expenses and eventual losses, our insurance operation registers an underwriting profit that adds to the investment income the float produces. When such a profit is earned, we enjoytheuseoffreemoney–and,betteryet,getpaidforholdingit. Unfortunately, the wish of all insurers to achieve this happy result creates intense competition, so vigorousindeedthatitsometimescausesthe P/Cindustryasawholetooperateatasignificantunderwritingloss. This loss, in effect, is what the industry pays to hold its float. Competitive dynamics almost guarantee that the insurance industry, despite the float income all its companies enjoy, will continue its dismal record of earning subnormalreturnsontangiblenetworthascomparedtoother Americanbusinesses. Thisoutcomeismademorecertainbythedramaticallylowerinterestratesthatnowexistthroughoutthe world. The investment portfolios of almost all P/C companies – though not those of Berkshire – are heavily concentrated in bonds. As these high-yielding legacy investments mature and are replaced by bonds yielding a pittance, earnings from float will steadily fall. For that reason, and others as well, it’s a good bet that industry results over the next ten years will fall short of those recorded in the past decade, particularly in the case of companiesthatspecializeinreinsurance. Nevertheless,Iverymuchlikeourownprospects.Berkshire’sunrivaledfinancialstrengthallowsusfar moreflexibilityininvestingthanthatgenerallyavailableto P/Ccompanies.Themanyalternativesavailabletous are always an advantage; occasionally, they offer us major opportunities. When others are constrained, our choicesexpand. Moreover, our P/Ccompanies have an excellent underwriting record. Berkshire hasnowoperated atan underwriting profit for 14 consecutive years, our pre-tax gain for the period having totaled $28 billion. That record is no accident: Disciplined risk evaluation is the daily focus of all of our insurance managers, whoknow that while float is valuable, its benefits can be drowned by poor underwriting results. All insurers give that messagelipservice.At Berkshireitisareligion,Old Testamentstyle. Sohowdoesourfloataffectintrinsicvalue?When Berkshire’sbookvalueiscalculated,thefullamount of our float is deducted as a liability, just as if we had to pay it out tomorrow and could not replenish it. But to thinkoffloatasatypicalliability isamajormistake.Itshouldinsteadbeviewedasarevolvingfund.Daily,we pay old claims and related expenses – a huge $27 billion to more than six million claimants in 2016 – and that reduces float. Just as surely, we each day write new business that will soon generate its own claims, adding to float. Ifourrevolvingfloatisbothcostlessandlong-enduring,which Ibelieveitwillbe,thetruevalueofthis liabilityisdramaticallylessthantheaccountingliability.Owing$1thatineffectwillneverleavethepremises– becausenewbusinessisalmostcertaintodeliverasubstitute–isworldsdifferentfromowing$1thatwillgoout thedoortomorrowandnotbereplaced.Thetwotypesofliabilities,however,aretreatedasequalsunder GAAP. Apartial offset tothisoverstated liability isa$15.5billion “goodwill” asset thatweincurredinbuying ourinsurancecompaniesandthatisincludedinourbook-valuefigure.Inverylargepart,thisgoodwillrepresents the price we paid for the float-generating capabilities of our insurance operations. The cost of the goodwill, however, has no bearing on its true value. For example, if an insurance company sustains large and prolonged underwriting losses, any goodwill asset carried on the books should be deemed valueless, whatever its original cost. Fortunately, that does not describe Berkshire. Charlie and I believe the true economic value of our insurance goodwill – what we would happily pay for float of similar quality were we to purchase an insurance operation possessing it–tobefarinexcessofitshistoric carrying value.Indeed,almost theentire$15.5billion we carry for goodwill in our insurance business was already on our books in 2000 when float was $28 billion. Yetwehavesubsequentlyincreasedourfloatby$64billion,againthatinnowayisreflectedinourbookvalue. This unrecorded asset is one reason – a huge reason – why we believe Berkshire’s intrinsic business value far exceedsitsbookvalue.   Berkshire’s attractive insurance economics exist only because we have some terrific managers running disciplined operations that in most cases possess hard-to-replicate business models. Let me tell you about the majorunits. First by float size is the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group, managed by Ajit Jain. Ajit insures risks that no one else has the desire or the capital to take on. His operation combines capacity, speed, decisiveness and, most important, brains in a manner unique in the insurance business. Yet he never exposes Berkshiretorisksthatareinappropriateinrelationtoourresources. Indeed,Berkshireisfarmoreconservativeinavoidingriskthanmostlargeinsurers.Forexample,ifthe insurance industry should experience a $250 billion loss from some mega-catastrophe – a loss about triple anythingithaseverexperienced–Berkshireasawholewouldlikelyrecordalargeprofitfortheyear.Ourmany streamsofnon-insurance earningswouldseetothat.Additionally,wewouldremainawashincashandbeeager to write business in an insurance market that might well be in disarray. Meanwhile, other major insurers and reinsurerswouldbeswimminginredink,ifnotfacinginsolvency. When Ajit entered Berkshire’s office on a Saturday in 1986, he did not have a day’s experience in the insurance business. Nevertheless, Mike Goldberg, then our manager of insurance, handed him the keys to our smallandstrugglingreinsurancebusiness.Withthatmove,Mikeachievedsainthood:Sincethen,Ajithascreated tensofbillionsofvaluefor Berkshireshareholders.Iftherewereevertobeanother Ajitandyoucouldswapme forhim,don’thesitate.Makethetrade!   Wehaveanotherreinsurancepowerhousein General Re,manageduntilrecentlyby Tad Montross.After 39 years at General Re, Tad retired in 2016. Tad was a class act in every way and we owe him a ton of thanks. Kara Raiguel,whohasworkedwith Ajitfor16years,isnow CEOof General Re. At bottom, a sound insurance operation needs to adhere to four disciplines. It must (1) understand all exposures that might cause a policy to incur losses; (2) conservatively assess the likelihood of any exposure actually causing a loss and the probable cost if it does; (3) set a premium that, on average, will deliver a profit after both prospective loss costs and operating expenses are covered; and (4) be willing to walk away if the appropriatepremiumcan’tbeobtained. Many insurers pass the first three tests and flunk the fourth. They simply can’t turn their back on business that is being eagerly written bytheir competitors. That old line, “The other guyis doing it, so wemust as well,” spells trouble in any business, but in none more so than insurance. Tad never listened to that nonsensicalexcuseforsloppyunderwriting,andneitherwill Kara.   Finally,thereis GEICO,thecompanythatsetmyheartafire66yearsago(andforwhichtheflamestill burns).GEICOismanagedby Tony Nicely,whojoinedthecompanyat18andcompleted55yearsofservicein 2016. Tony became CEO of GEICO in 1993, and since then the company has been flying. There is no better manager than Tony, who brings his combination of brilliance, dedication and soundness to the job. (The latter quality is essential to sustained success. As Charlie says, it’s great to have a manager with a 160IQ–unless he thinksit’s180.)Like Ajit,Tonyhascreatedtensofbillionsofvaluefor Berkshire. On my initial visit to GEICO in 1951, I was blown away by the huge cost advantage the company enjoyed over the giants of the industry.

Less than three years ago, we formed Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance (“BHSI”), which is included in this grouping.

Regulated,Capital-Intensive Businesses Our BNSF railroad and Berkshire Hathaway Energy (“BHE”), our 90%-owned utility business, share important characteristics that distinguish them from Berkshire’s other activities. Consequently, we assign them their own section in this letter and split out their combined financial statistics in our GAAP balance sheet and income statement. These two very major companies accounted for 33% of Berkshire’s after-tax operating earningslastyear. A key characteristic of both companies is their huge investment in very long-lived, regulated assets, withthesepartially fundedbylargeamountsoflong-term debtthatisnotguaranteedby Berkshire.Ourcreditis infactnotneededbecauseeachcompanyhasearningpowerthatevenunderterribleeconomicconditionswould farexceeditsinterestrequirements.Lastyear,forexample,inadisappointingyearforrailroads,BNSF’sinterest coverage was more than 6:1. (Our definition of coverage is the ratio of earnings before interest and taxes to interest,not EBITDA/interest,acommonly-usedmeasureweviewasseriouslyflawed.) At BHE, meanwhile, two factors ensure the company’s ability to service its debt under all circumstances. The first is common to all utilities: recession-resistant earnings, which result from these companies offering an essential service for which demand is remarkably steady. The second is enjoyed by few otherutilities:anever-wideningdiversityofearningsstreams,whichshield BHEfrombeingseriouslyharmedby any single regulatory body. These many sources of profit, supplemented by the inherent advantage of the company being owned by a strong parent, have allowed BHE and its utility subsidiaries to significantly lower theircostofdebt.Thateconomicfactbenefitsbothusandourcustomers.

We have promised Iowans that our base rates will not increase until 2029 at the earliest. Our rock-bottompricesadduptorealmoneyforpaycheck-strappedcustomers. At BNSF, price comparisons between major railroads are far more difficult to make because of significant differences in both their mix of cargo and the average distance the load is carried. To supply a very crude measure, however, our revenue per ton-mile was 3¢ last year, while shipping costs for customers of the otherfourmajor U.S.-basedrailroadsrangedfrom4¢to5¢. Both BHEand BNSFhave been leaders in pursuing planet-friendly technology. In windgeneration, no state comesclosetorivaling Iowa,wherelastyearthemegawatt-hours wegeneratedfromwindequaled55%of all megawatt-hours sold to our Iowa retail customers. Newwindprojects that are underway will take that figure to89%by2020. Bargain-basement electric rates carry second-order benefits with them. Iowa has attracted large high- tech installations, both because of its low prices for electricity (which data centers use in huge quantities) and because most tech CEOsare enthusiastic aboutusingrenewable energy.Whenitcomestowindenergy,Iowais the Saudi Arabiaof America. BNSF, like other Class I railroads, uses only a single gallon of diesel fuel to move a ton of freight almost 500 miles. Those economics make railroads four times as fuel-efficient as trucks! Furthermore, railroads alleviate highway congestion – and the taxpayer-funded maintenance expenditures that come with heavier traffic–inamajorway. All told, BHE and BNSF own assets that are of major importance to our country as well as to shareholdersof Berkshire.Herearethekeyfinancialfiguresforboth: BNSF Earnings(inmillions) 2016 2015 2014 Revenues  $ 19,829 $ 21,967 $ 23,239 Operatingexpenses  13,144 14,264 16,237 Operatingearningsbeforeinterestandtaxes  6,685 7,703 7,002 Interest(net)   992 928 833 Incometaxes  2,124 2,527 2,300 Netearnings  $ 3,569 $ 4,248 $ 3,869 Berkshire Hathaway Energy(90%owned) Earnings(inmillions) 2016 2015 2014 U.K.utilities  $ 367 $ 460 $ 527 Iowautility  392 292 270 Nevadautilities   559 586 549 Pacifi Corp(primarily Oregonand Utah)  1,105 1,026 1,010 Gaspipelines(Northern Naturaland Kern River)  413 401 379 Canadiantransmissionutility   147 170 16 Renewableprojects  157 175 194 Home Services  225 191 139 Other(net)  73 49 54 Operatingearningsbeforecorporateinterestandtaxes  3,438 3,350 3,138 Interest   465 499 427 Incometaxes  431 481 616 Netearnings  $ 2,542 $ 2,370 $ 2,095 Earningsapplicableto Berkshire  $ 2,287 $ 2,132 $ 1,882 Home Services may appear out of place in the above table.

Therefore, in certain of our operations that are not of a size material to an evaluation of Berkshire, we only disclose what is required. You can nevertheless find a good bit of detail about many of our operations on pages 90 - 94. Be aware, though, that it’s the growth of the Berkshire forest that counts.Itwouldbefoolishtofocusover-intentlyonanysingletree.   For several years I have told you that the income and expense data shown in this section does not conform to GAAP. I have explained that this divergence occurs primarily because of GAAP-ordered rules regarding purchase-accounting adjustments that require the full amortization of certain intangibles over periods averaging about19years.Inouropinion,mostofthoseamortization “expenses” arenottrulyaneconomiccost. Ourgoalindivergingfrom GAAPinthissectionistopresentthefigurestoyouinamannerreflectingthewayin which Charlieand Iviewandanalyzethem.

Eventuallyamortization chargesfullywriteofftherelatedasset.Whenthathappens–mostoftenatthe 15-year mark – the GAAP earnings we report will increase without any true improvement in the underlying economicsof Berkshire’sbusiness.(Mygifttomysuccessor.) Now that I’ve described a GAAP expense that I believe to be overstated, let me move on to a less pleasantdistortionproducedbyaccountingrules.Thesubjectthistimeis GAAP-prescribeddepreciationcharges, which are necessarily based on historical cost. Yet in certain cases, those charges materially understate true economic costs. Countless words were written about this phenomenon in the 1970s and early 1980s, when inflation was rampant. As inflation subsided – thanks to heroic actions by Paul Volcker – the inadequacy of depreciation charges became less of an issue. But the problem still prevails, big time, in the railroad industry, wherecurrent costsformanydepreciable items faroutstrip historical costs.Theinevitable resultisthatreported earningsthroughouttherailroadindustryareconsiderablyhigherthantrueeconomicearnings. At BNSF,togetdowntoparticulars,our GAAPdepreciationchargelastyearwas$2.1billion.Butwere we to spend that sum and no more annually, our railroad would soon deteriorate and become less competitive. Therealityisthat–simplytoholdourown–weneedtospendfarmorethanthecostweshowfordepreciation. Moreover,awidedisparitywillprevailfordecades. Allthatsaid,Charlieand Iloveourrailroad,whichwasoneofourbetterpurchases.   Too many managements – and the number seems to grow every year – are looking for any means to report, and indeed feature, “adjusted earnings” that are higher than their company’s GAAP earnings. There are many ways for practitioners to perform this legerdemain. Two of their favorites are the omission of “restructuringcosts”and“stock-basedcompensation”asexpenses. Charlie and I want managements, in their commentary, to describe unusual items – good or bad – that affect the GAAPnumbers. Afterall,thereasonwelookatthesenumbers ofthepastistomakeestimates ofthe future. But a management that regularly attempts to wave away very real costs by highlighting “adjusted per-share earnings” makes us nervous. That’s because bad behavior is contagious: CEOs who overtly look for ways to report high numbers tend to foster a culture in which subordinates strive to be “helpful” as well. Goals likethatcanlead,forexample,toinsurersunderestimatingtheirlossreserves,apracticethathasdestroyedmany industryparticipants. Charlie and I cringe whenwehear analysts talk admiringly about managements whoalways “make the numbers.” In truth, business is too unpredictable for the numbers always to be met. Inevitably, surprises occur. Whentheydo,a CEOwhosefocusiscenteredon Wall Streetwillbetemptedtomakeupthenumbers. Let’s get back to the two favorites of “don’t-count-this” managers, starting with “restructuring.” Berkshire, I would say, has been restructuring from the first day we took over in 1965. Owning only a northern textile business then gave us no other choice. And today a fair amount of restructuring occurs every year at Berkshire.That’sbecausetherearealwaysthingsthatneedtochangeinourhundredsofbusinesses.Lastyear,as Imentionedearlier,wespentsignificantsumsgetting Duracellinshapeforthedecadesahead. Wehavenever,however,singledoutrestructuringchargesandtoldyoutoignoretheminestimatingour normalearningpower.Ifthereweretobesometrulymajorexpensesinasingleyear,Iwould,ofcourse,mention itinmycommentary.Indeed,whenthereisatotalrebasingofabusiness,suchasoccurredwhen Kraftand Heinz merged,itisimperativethatforseveralyearsthehugeone-timecostsofrationalizingthecombinedoperationsbe explained clearly to owners. That’s precisely what the CEO of Kraft Heinz has done, in a manner approved by the company’s directors (who include me). But, to tell owners year after year, “Don’t count this,” when managementissimplymakingbusinessadjustmentsthatarenecessary,ismisleading.Andtoomanyanalystsand journalistsfallforthisbaloney. To say “stock-based compensation” is not an expense is even more cavalier. CEOs who go down that road are, in effect, saying to shareholders, “If you pay me a bundle in options or restricted stock, don’t worry aboutitseffectonearnings.I’ll‘adjust’itaway.” To explore this maneuver further, join me for a moment in a visit to a make-believe accounting laboratory whose sole mission is to juice Berkshire’s reported earnings. Imaginative technicians await us, eager toshowtheirstuff. Listencarefullywhile Itelltheseenablersthatstock-basedcompensationusuallycomprisesatleast20% oftotalcompensationforthetopthreeorfourexecutivesatmostlargecompanies.Payattention,too,as Iexplain that Berkshire has several hundred such executives at its subsidiaries and pays them similar amounts, but uses only cash to do so. I further confess that, lacking imagination, I have counted all of these payments to Berkshire’sexecutivesasanexpense. My accounting minions suppress a giggle and immediately point out that 20% of what is paid these Berkshire managers is tantamount to “cash paid in lieu of stock-based compensation” and is therefore not a “true”expense.So–presto!–Berkshire,too,canhave“adjusted”earnings. Backtoreality: If CEOswanttoleaveoutstock-basedcompensationinreportingearnings,theyshould berequiredtoaffirmtotheirownersoneoftwopropositions:whyitemsofvalueusedtopayemployeesarenota costorwhyapayrollcostshouldbeexcludedwhencalculatingearnings. During the accounting nonsense that flourished during the 1960s, the story was told of a CEO who, as his company revved up to go public, asked prospective auditors, “What is two plus two?” The answer that won theassignment,ofcourse,was,“Whatnumberdoyouhaveinmind?” Financeand Financial Products Our three leasing and rental operations are conducted by CORT (furniture), XTRA (semi-trailers), and Marmon (primarily tank cars but also freight cars, intermodal tank containers and cranes). Each is the leader in itsfield. Wealsoinclude Clayton Homesinthissection.Thiscompanyreceivesmostofitsrevenuefromthesale ofmanufacturedhomes,butderivesthebulkofitsearningsfromitslargemortgageportfolio.Lastyear,Clayton became America’s largest home builder, delivering 42,075 units that accounted for 5% of all new American homes. (In fairness, other large builders do far more dollar volume than Clayton because they sell site-built homesthatcommandmuchhigherprices.) In 2015, Clayton branched out, purchasing its first site-builder. Two similar acquisitions followed in 2016,and more will come. Site-built houses are expected to amount to 3% or so of Clayton’s unitsales in2017 andwilllikelydeliverabout14%ofitsdollarvolume. Even so, Clayton’s focus will always be manufactured homes, which account for about 70% of new Americanhomescostinglessthan$150,000.Claytonmanufacturesclosetoone-halfofthetotal.Thatisafarcry from Clayton’s position in 2003 when Berkshire purchased the company. It then ranked third in the industry in units sold and employed 6,731 people. Now, when its new acquisitions are included, the employee count is 14,677.Andthatnumberwillincreaseinthefuture. Clayton’searningsinrecentyearshavemateriallybenefitedfromextraordinarilylowinterestrates.The company’s mortgage loans to home-buyers are at fixed-rates and for long terms (averaging 25 years at inception). But Clayton’s own borrowings are short-term credits that re-price frequently. When rates plunge, Clayton’s earnings from its portfolio greatly increase. We normally would shun that kind of lend-long, borrow- short approach, which can cause major problems for financial institutions. As a whole, however, Berkshire is always asset-sensitive, meaning that higher short-term rates will benefit our consolidated earnings, even as they hurtat Clayton. Last year Clayton had to foreclose on 8,304 manufactured-housing mortgages, about 2.5% of its total portfolio. Customer demographics help explain that percentage. Clayton’s customers are usually lower-income families with mediocre credit scores; many are supported by jobs that will be at risk in any recession; many, similarly, havefinancial profiles thatwillbedamagedbydivorceordeathtoanextentthatwouldnotbetypical for a high-income family. Those risks that our customers face are partly mitigated because almost all have a strong desire to own a home and because they enjoy reasonable monthly payments that average only $587, includingthecostofinsuranceandpropertytaxes. Clayton also has long had programs that help borrowers through difficulties. The two most popular are loan extensions and payment forgiveness. Last year about 11,000 borrowers received extensions, and 3,800 had $3.4 million of scheduled payments permanently canceled by Clayton. The company does not earn interest or fees when these loss-mitigation moves are made. Ourexperience is that 93% of borrowers helped through these programs in the last two years now remain in their homes. Since we lose significant sums on foreclosures – losses last year totaled $150million –our assistance programs end uphelping Clayton as well as itsborrowers.

If the dividend rate on Bank of America common stock – now 30 cents annually – should rise above 44 cents before 2021, we would anticipate making a cashless exchange of our preferred into common. If the common dividend remains below 44 cents, it is highly probable that we will exercise the warrant immediately beforeitexpires. Many of our investees, including Bank of America, have been repurchasing shares, some quite aggressively. We very much like this behavior because we believe the repurchased shares have in most cases been underpriced. (Undervaluation, after all, is why we own these positions.) When a company grows and outstandingsharesshrink,goodthingshappenforshareholders.   It’simportantforyoutounderstandthat95%ofthe$86billionof“cashandequivalents”(whichinmy mind includes U.S. Treasury Bills) shown on our balance sheet are held by entities in the United States and, consequently, is not subject to any repatriation tax. Moreover, repatriation of the remaining funds would trigger only minor taxes because much of that money has been earned in countries that themselves impose meaningful corporatetaxes.Thosepaymentsbecomeanoffsetto U.S.taxwhenmoneyisbroughthome. These explanations are important because many cash-rich American companies hold a large portion of theirfundsinjurisdictionsimposingverylowtaxes.Suchcompanieshope–andmaywellbeprovedright–that the tax levied for bringing these funds to America will soon be materially reduced. In the meantime, these companies are limited as to how they can use that cash. In other words, off-shore cash is simply not worth as muchascashheldathome.

Confusion about this point may have resulted from a too-casual reading of Economic Principle 11 on pages 110 - 111, which has been included in our annual reports since 1983. That principle covers controlled businesses, not marketable securities. This year I’ve added a final sentence to #11 to ensure that our owners understandthatweregardanymarketablesecurityasavailableforsale,howeverunlikelysuchasalenowseems.   Beforeweleavethisinvestmentsection,afeweducationalwordsaboutdividendsandtaxes:Berkshire, like most corporations, nets considerably more from a dollar of dividends than it reaps from a dollar of capital gains. That will probably surprise those of our shareholders who are accustomed to thinking of capital gains as theroutetotax-favoredreturns. But here’s the corporate math. Every $1 of capital gains that a corporation realizes carries with it 35centsoffederalincometax(andoftenstateincometaxaswell).Thetaxondividendsreceivedfromdomestic corporations,however,isconsistentlylower,thoughratesvarydependingonthestatusoftherecipient. Foranon-insurancecompany–whichdescribes Berkshire Hathaway,theparent–thefederaltaxrateis effectively101⁄ 2centsper$1ofdividendsreceived.Furthermore,anon-insurancecompanythatownsmorethan 20% of an investee owes taxes of only 7 cents per $1 of dividends. That rate applies, for example, to the substantial dividends we receive from our 27% ownership of Kraft Heinz, all of it held by the parent company. (The rationale for the low corporate taxes on dividends is that the dividend-paying investee has already paid its owncorporatetaxontheearningsbeingdistributed.) Berkshire’sinsurancesubsidiariespayataxrateondividendsthatissomewhathigherthanthatapplying to non-insurance companies, though the rate is still well below the 35% hitting capital gains. Property/casualty companies oweabout 14% in taxes onmost dividends they receive. Their tax rate falls, though,toabout11%if theyownmorethan20%ofa U.S.-basedinvestee. Andthat’sourtaxlessonfortoday. “The Bet”(orhowyourmoneyfindsitswayto Wall Street) In this section, you will encounter, early on, the story of an investment bet I made nine years ago and, next, some strong opinions I have about investing. As a starter, though, I want to briefly describe Long Bets, a uniqueestablishmentthatplayedaroleinthebet. Long Bets was seeded by Amazon’s Jeff Bezos and operates as a non-profit organization that administersjustwhatyou’dguess:long-termbets.Toparticipate,“proposers”postapropositionat Longbets.org thatwillbeprovedright orwrongatadistant date.Theythenwaitforacontrary-minded partytotaketheother sideofthebet.Whena“doubter”stepsforward,eachsidenamesacharitythatwillbethebeneficiaryifitsside wins; parks its wager with Long Bets; and posts a short essay defending its position on the Long Bets website.

Hereareexamplesofwhatyouwillfindon Long Bets’veryinterestingsite: In2002,entrepreneur Mitch Kaporassertedthat“By2029nocomputer–or‘machineintelligence’–will have passed the Turing Test,” which deals with whether a computer cansuccessfullyimpersonate a humanbeing. Inventor Ray Kurzweil took the opposing view. Each backed up his opinion with $10,000. I don’t knowwho will winthisbet,but Iwillconfidentlywagerthatnocomputerwilleverreplicate Charlie. Thatsameyear,Craig Mundieof Microsoftassertedthatpilotlessplaneswouldroutinelyflypassengers by 2030, while Eric Schmidt of Google argued otherwise. The stakes were $1,000 each. To ease any heartburn Eric might be experiencing from his outsized exposure, I recently offered to take a piece of his action. He promptly laid off $500 with me. (I like his assumption that I’ll be around in 2030 to contribute my payment, shouldwelose.) Now, to my bet and its history. In Berkshire’s 2005 annual report, I argued that active investment managementbyprofessionals–inaggregate–wouldoveraperiodofyearsunderperformthereturnsachievedby rank amateurs who simply sat still. I explained that the massive fees levied by a variety of “helpers” would leave theirclients–againinaggregate–worseoffthaniftheamateurssimplyinvestedinanunmanagedlow-costindex fund.(Seepages114-115forareprintoftheargumentas Ioriginallystateditinthe2005report.) Subsequently, I publicly offered to wager $500,000 that no investment pro could select a set of at least five hedge funds – wildly-popular and high-fee investing vehicles – that would over an extended period match the performance of an unmanaged S&P-500 index fund charging only token fees.Isuggested aten-year betand named a low-cost Vanguard S&P fund as my contender. I then sat back and waited expectantly for a parade of fund managers – who could include their own fund as one of the five – to come forth and defend their occupation.Afterall,thesemanagersurgedotherstobetbillionsontheirabilities.Whyshouldtheyfearputting alittleoftheirownmoneyontheline? Whatfollowedwasthesoundofsilence.Thoughtherearethousandsofprofessionalinvestmentmanagers who have amassed staggering fortunes by touting their stock-selecting prowess, only one man – Ted Seides – stepped up to my challenge.

Thecompounded annual increase to date for the index fund is 7.1%, which is a return thatcouldeasily prove typical for the stock market over time. That’s an important fact: A particularly weak nine years for the market over the lifetime of this bet would have probably helped the relative performance of the hedge funds, because many hold large “short” positions. Conversely, nine years of exceptionally high returns from stocks wouldhaveprovidedatailwindforindexfunds. Instead we operated in what I would call a “neutral” environment. In it, the five funds-of-funds delivered, through 2016, an average of only 2.2%, compounded annually. That means $1 million invested in thosefundswouldhavegained$220,000.Theindexfundwouldmeanwhilehavegained$854,000. Bear in mind that every one of the 100-plus managers of the underlying hedge funds had a huge financial incentive to do his or her best. Moreover, the five funds-of-funds managers that Ted selected were similarly incentivized to select the best hedge-fund managers possible because the five were entitled to performancefeesbasedontheresultsoftheunderlyingfunds. I’m certain that in almost all cases the managers at both levels were honest and intelligent people. But the results for their investors were dismal – really dismal. And, alas, the huge fixed fees charged by all of the funds and funds-of-funds involved – fees that were totally unwarranted by performance – were such that their managerswereshoweredwithcompensationoverthenineyearsthathavepassed.As Gordon Gekkomighthave putit:“Feesneversleep.” The underlying hedge-fund managers in our bet received payments from their limited partners that likely averaged a bit under the prevailing hedge-fund standard of “2 and 20,” meaning a 2% annual fixed fee, payable even when losses are huge, and 20% of profits with no clawback (if good years were followed by bad ones). Under this lopsided arrangement, a hedge fund operator’s ability to simply pile up assets under management has made many of these managers extraordinarily rich, even as their investments have performed poorly. Still, we’renotthroughwithfees. Remember, there werethefund-of-funds managers tobefedaswell. These managers received an additional fixed amount that was usually set at 1% of assets. Then, despite the terrible overall record of the five funds-of-funds, some experienced a few good years and collected “performance” fees. Consequently, I estimate that over the nine-year period roughly 60% – gulp! – of all gains achieved by the five funds-of-funds were diverted to the two levels of managers. That was their misbegotten reward for accomplishing something far short of what their many hundreds of limited partners could have effortlessly–andwithvirtuallynocost–achievedontheirown. Inmyopinion,thedisappointingresultsforhedge-fundinvestorsthatthisbetexposedarealmostcertain torecurinthefuture.Ilaidoutmyreasonsforthatbeliefinastatementthatwaspostedonthe Long Betswebsite whenthebetcommenced(andthatisstillpostedthere).Hereiswhat Iasserted: Overaten-yearperiodcommencingon January1,2008,andendingon December31,2017, the S&P 500 will outperform a portfolio of funds of hedge funds, when performance is measuredonabasisnetoffees,costsandexpenses.

In aggregate their positions will more or less approximate those of an index fund. Therefore, the balance of the universe—the active investors—must do about average as well. However, these investorswillincurfargreatercosts.So,onbalance,theiraggregateresultsafterthesecosts willbeworsethanthoseofthepassiveinvestors. Costsskyrocketwhenlargeannualfees,largeperformancefees,andactivetradingcostsare all added to the active investor’s equation. Funds of hedge funds accentuate this cost problem because their fees are superimposed on the large fees charged by the hedge funds inwhichthefundsoffundsareinvested. A number of smart people are involved in running hedge funds. But to a great extent their efforts are self-neutralizing, and their IQ will not overcome the costs they impose on investors. Investors, on average and over time, will do better with a low-cost index fund thanwithagroupoffundsoffunds. So that was my argument – and now let me put it into a simple equation. If Group A(active investors) and Group B (do-nothing investors) comprise the total investing universe, and B is destined to achieve average resultsbeforecosts,so,too,must A.Whichevergrouphasthelowercostswillwin.(Theacademicinmerequires me to mention that there is a very minor point – not worth detailing – that slightly modifies this formulation.) Andif Group Ahasexorbitantcosts,itsshortfallwillbesubstantial. There are, of course, some skilled individuals who are highly likely to out-perform the S&P over long stretches. In my lifetime, though, I’ve identified – early on – only ten or so professionals that I expected would accomplishthisfeat.

Of course, 1,000 monkeys would be just as likely to produce a seemingly all-wise prophet. But there would remain a difference: The lucky monkey would not find people standing in line to invest with him. Finally, there are three connected realities that cause investing success to breed failure. First, a good record quickly attracts a torrent of money. Second, huge sums invariably act as an anchor on investment performance: What is easy with millions, struggles with billions (sob!). Third, most managers will nevertheless seeknewmoneybecauseoftheirpersonalequation–namely,themorefundstheyhaveundermanagement,the moretheirfees. Thesethreepointsarehardlynewgroundforme:In January1966,when Iwasmanaging$44million,I wrote my limited partners: “I feel substantially greater size is more likely to harm future results than to help them.Thismightnotbetrueformyownpersonalresults,butitislikelytobetrueforyourresults.Therefore,... Iintendtoadmitnoadditionalpartnersto BPL.Ihavenotified Susiethatifwehaveanymorechildren,itisupto hertofindsomeotherpartnershipforthem.” The bottom line: When trillions of dollars are managed by Wall Streeters charging high fees, it will usually be the managers who reap outsized profits, not the clients. Both large and small investors should stick withlow-costindexfunds.   Ifastatueisevererectedtohonorthepersonwhohasdonethemostfor Americaninvestors,thehands- downchoiceshouldbe Jack Bogle.Fordecades,Jackhasurgedinvestorstoinvestinultra-low-costindexfunds. In his crusade, he amassed only a tiny percentage of the wealth that has typically flowed to managers whohave promised their investors large rewards while delivering them nothing – or, as in our bet, less than nothing – of addedvalue. In his early years, Jack was frequently mocked by the investment-management industry. Today, however,hehasthesatisfactionofknowingthathehelpedmillionsofinvestorsrealizefarbetterreturnsontheir savingsthantheyotherwisewouldhaveearned.Heisaherotothemandtome.   Over the years, I’ve often been asked for investment advice, and in the process of answering I’ve learned a good deal about human behavior. My regular recommendation has been a low-cost S&P 500 index fund.Totheircredit,myfriendswhopossessonlymodestmeanshaveusuallyfollowedmysuggestion. I believe, however, that none of the mega-rich individuals, institutions or pension funds has followed that same advice when I’ve given it to them. Instead, these investors politely thank me for my thoughts and depart to listen to the siren song of a high-fee manager or, in the case of many institutions, to seek out another breedofhyper-helpercalledaconsultant. That professional, however, faces a problem. Can you imagine an investment consultant telling clients, year after year, to keep adding to an index fund replicating the S&P 500? That would be career suicide. Large fees flow to these hyper-helpers, however, if they recommend small managerial shifts every year or so. That advice is often delivered in esoteric gibberish that explains why fashionable investment “styles” or current economictrendsmaketheshiftappropriate. The wealthy are accustomed to feeling that it is their lot in life to get the best food, schooling, entertainment, housing, plastic surgery, sports ticket, you name it. Their money, they feel, should buy them somethingsuperiorcomparedtowhatthemassesreceive. In many aspects of life, indeed, wealth does command top-grade products or services. For that reason, thefinancial“elites”–wealthyindividuals,pensionfunds,collegeendowmentsandthelike–havegreattrouble meekly signing up for a financial product or service that is available as well to people investing only a few thousand dollars. This reluctance of the rich normally prevails even though the product at issue is –on an expectancy basis – clearly the best choice. My calculation, admittedly very rough, is that the search by the elite forsuperiorinvestment advicehascausedit,inaggregate,towastemorethan$100billionoverthepastdecade. Figure it out: Even a 1% fee on a few trillion dollars adds up. Of course, not every investor who put money in hedge funds ten years ago lagged S&P returns. But I believe my calculation of the aggregate shortfall is conservative. Much of the financial damage befell pension funds for public employees. Many of these funds are woefully underfunded, in part because they have suffered a double whammy: poor investment performance accompanied by huge fees. The resulting shortfalls in their assets will for decades have to be made up by local taxpayers. Human behavior won’t change. Wealthy individuals, pension funds, endowments and the like will continue to feel they deserve something “extra” in investment advice. Those advisors who cleverly play to this expectation will get very rich. This year the magic potion may be hedge funds, next year something else. The likely result from this parade of promises is predicted in an adage: “When a person with money meets a person with experience, the one with experience ends up with the money and the one with money leaves with experience.” Long ago, a brother-in-law of mine, Homer Rogers, was a commission agent working in the Omaha stockyards. Iaskedhimhowheinducedafarmerorranchertohirehimtohandlethesaleoftheirhogsorcattle to the buyers from the big four packers (Swift, Cudahy, Wilson and Armour). After all, hogs were hogs and the buyers were experts whoknewto the penny howmuch any animal was worth. Howthen, I asked Homer, could anysalesagentgetabetterresultthananyother? Homer gave me a pitying look and said: “Warren, it’s not how you sell ‘em, it’s how you tell ‘em.” Whatworkedinthestockyardscontinuestoworkin Wall Street.   And, finally, let me offer an olive branch to Wall Streeters, many of them good friends of mine.

While I’m on the subject of our owners’ gaining knowledge, let me remind you that Charlie and I believe all shareholders should simultaneously have access to new information that Berkshire releases and, if possible, should also have adequate time to digest and analyze it before any trading takes place. That’s why we try to issue financial data late on Fridays or early on Saturdays andwhyourannualmeeting isalwaysheldona Saturday(adaythatalsoeasestrafficandparkingproblems).

For good reason, I regularly extol the accomplishments of our operating managers. They are truly All-Stars who run their businesses as if they were the only asset owned by their families.
