BERKSHIREHATHAWAYINC. Tothe Shareholdersof Berkshire Hathaway Inc.: Berkshire’s gain in net worth during 2015 was $15.4 billion, which increased the per-share book value of both our Class A and Class B stock by 6.4%. Over the last 51years (that is, since present management took over), per-sharebookvaluehasgrownfrom$19to$155,501,arateof19.2%compoundedannually.* During the first half of those years, Berkshire’s net worth was roughly equal to the number that really counts: the intrinsic value of the business. The similarity of the two figures existed then because most of our resourcesweredeployedinmarketablesecuritiesthatwereregularlyrevaluedtotheirquotedprices(lessthetaxthat would be incurred if they were to be sold). In Wall Street parlance, our balance sheet was then in very large part “markedtomarket.” By the early 1990s, however, our focus had changed to the outright ownership of businesses, a shift that diminishedtherelevanceofbalance-sheetfigures.Thatdisconnectoccurredbecausetheaccountingrulesthatapply to controlled companies are materially different from those used in valuing marketable securities.

Over time, this asymmetrical accounting treatment (with which we agree) necessarily widens the gap betweenintrinsicvalueandbookvalue.Today,thelarge–andgrowing–unrecordedgainsatour“winners”makeit clear that Berkshire’s intrinsic value far exceeds its book value.

After a poor performance in 2014, our BNSF railroad dramatically improved its service to customers last year. To attain that result, we invested about $5.8 billion during the year in capital expenditures, a sum far and away the record for any American railroad and nearly three times our annual depreciationcharge.Itwasmoneywellspent. BNSF moves about 17% of America’s intercity freight (measured by revenue ton-miles), whether transported by rail, truck, air, water or pipeline. In that respect, we are a strong number one among the sevenlarge Americanrailroads(twoofwhichare Canadian-based),carrying45%moreton-milesoffreight than our closest competitor. Consequently, our maintaining first-class service is not only vital to our shippers’welfarebutalsoimportanttothesmoothfunctioningofthe U.S.economy. For most American railroads, 2015 was a disappointing year. Aggregate ton-miles fell, and earnings weakened as well. BNSF, however, maintained volume, and pre-tax income rose to a record $6.8 billion* (a gain of $606 million from 2014). Matt Rose and Carl Ice, the managers of BNSF, have my thanks and deserveyours. ‹ BNSF is the largest of our “Powerhouse Five,” a group that also includes Berkshire Hathaway Energy, Marmon, Lubrizol and IMC. Combined, these companies – our five most profitable non-insurance businesses–earned$13.1billionin2015,anincreaseof$650millionover2014. Of the five, only Berkshire Hathaway Energy, then earning $393 million, was owned by us in 2003. Subsequently, we purchased three of the other four on an all-cash basis. In acquiring BNSF, however, we paid about 70% of the cost in cash and, for the remainder, issued Berkshire shares that increased the numberoutstandingby6.1%.Inotherwords,the$12.7billiongaininannualearningsdelivered Berkshire by the five companies over the twelve-year span has been accompanied by only minor dilution. That satisfiesourgoalofnotsimplyincreasingearnings,butmakingsurewealsoincreaseper-shareresults. ‹ Next year, I will be discussing the “Powerhouse Six.” The newcomer will be Precision Castparts Corp.

At much of corporate America,trulymajorgainsinproductivityarepossible,afactofferingopportunitiesto Jorge Pauloandhis associates. At Berkshire, we, too, crave efficiency and detest bureaucracy. To achieve our goals, however, we follow an approach emphasizing avoidance of bloat, buying businesses such as PCC that have long been run by cost-conscious and efficient managers. After the purchase, our role is simply to create an environment in which these CEOs – and their eventual successors, who typically are like-minded – can maximize both theirmanagerialeffectivenessandthepleasuretheyderivefromtheirjobs.(Withthishands-offstyle,Iam heeding a well-known Mungerism: “If you want to guarantee yourself a lifetime of misery, be sure to marrysomeonewiththeintentofchangingtheirbehavior.”) Wewillcontinue tooperate withextreme –indeed,almostunheardof–decentralization at Berkshire.But we will also look for opportunities to partner with Jorge Paulo, either as a financing partner, as was the case whenhis group purchased Tim Horton’s, or as a combined equity-and-financing partner, as at Heinz. Wealsomayoccasionallypartnerwithothers,aswehavesuccessfullydoneat Berkadia. Berkshire, however, will join only with partners making friendly acquisitions. To be sure, certain hostile offersarejustified:Some CEOsforgetthatitisshareholdersforwhomtheyshouldbeworking,whileother managers are woefully inept. In either case, directors may be blind to the problem or simply reluctant to makethechangerequired.That’swhennewfacesareneeded.We,though,willleavethese“opportunities” forothers.At Berkshire,wegoonlywherewearewelcome. ‹ Berkshire increased its ownership interest last year in each of its “Big Four” investments – American Express, Coca-Cola, IBM and Wells Fargo. We purchased additional shares of IBM (increasing our ownershipto8.4%versus7.8%atyearend2014)and Wells Fargo(goingto9.8%from9.4%).Attheother twocompanies,Coca-Colaand American Express,stockrepurchasesraisedourpercentageownership.Our equityin Coca-Colagrewfrom9.2%to9.3%,andourinterestin American Expressincreasedfrom14.8% to 15.6%. In case you think these seemingly small changes aren’t important, consider this math: For the four companies in aggregate, each increase of one percentage point in our ownership raises Berkshire’s portionoftheirannualearningsbyabout$500million. These four investees possess excellent businesses and are run by managers who are both talented and shareholder-oriented. Theirreturnsontangibleequityrangefromexcellenttostaggering.At Berkshire,we muchprefer owninganon-controlling butsubstantial portion ofawonderful companytoowning100%of aso-sobusiness.It’sbettertohaveapartialinterestinthe Hope Diamondthantoownallofarhinestone. If Berkshire’s yearend holdings are used as the marker, our portion of the “Big Four’s” 2015 earnings amounted to $4.7 billion. In the earnings we report to you, however, we include only the dividends they pay us – about $1.8 billion last year. But make no mistake: The nearly $3 billion of these companies’ earningswedon’treportareeverybitasvaluabletousastheportion Berkshirerecords. Theearningsourinvesteesretainareoftenusedforrepurchasesoftheirownstock–amovethatincreases Berkshire’s share of future earnings without requiring us to lay out a dime. Theretained earnings of these companies also fund business opportunities that usually turn out to be advantageous. All that leads us to expectthattheper-shareearningsofthesefourinvestees,inaggregate,willgrowsubstantiallyovertime.If gains do indeed materialize, dividends to Berkshire will increase and so, too, will our unrealized capital gains. Our flexibility in capital allocation – our willingness to invest large sums passively in non-controlled businesses – gives us a significant edge over companies that limit themselves to acquisitions they will operate. Woody Allen once explained that the advantage of being bi-sexual is that it doubles your chance offindingadateon Saturdaynight.Inlikemanner–well,notexactlylikemanner–ourappetiteforeither operating businesses or passive investments doubles our chances of finding sensible uses for Berkshire’s endless gusher of cash. Beyond that, having a huge portfolio of marketable securities gives us a stockpile offundsthatcanbetappedwhenanelephant-sizedacquisitionisofferedtous.   It’s an election year, and candidates can’t stop speaking about our country’s problems (which, of course, onlytheycansolve).Asaresultofthisnegativedrumbeat,many Americansnowbelievethattheirchildrenwillnot liveaswellastheythemselvesdo. Thatviewisdeadwrong:Thebabiesbeingbornin Americatodayaretheluckiestcropinhistory. American GDP per capita is now about $56,000. As I mentioned last year that – in real terms – is a staggeringsixtimestheamountin1930,theyear Iwasborn,aleapfarbeyondthewildestdreamsofmyparentsor their contemporaries. U.S. citizens are not intrinsically more intelligent today, nor do they work harder than did Americansin1930.Rather,theyworkfarmoreefficiently andtherebyproducefarmore.Thisall-powerfultrendis certaintocontinue:America’seconomicmagicremainsaliveandwell. Some commentators bemoan our current 2% per year growth in real GDP–and, yes, wewouldall like to seeahigherrate.Butlet’sdosomesimplemathusingthemuch-lamented2%figure.Thatrate,wewillsee,delivers astoundinggains. America’s population is growing about.8% per year (.5% from births minus deaths and.3% from net migration). Thus2%ofoverall growthproducesabout1.2%ofpercapitagrowth.Thatmaynotsoundimpressive. But in a single generation of, say, 25 years, that rate of growth leads to a gain of 34.4% in real GDP per capita. (Compounding’seffectsproducetheexcessoverthepercentagethatwouldresultbysimplymultiplying25x1.2%.) Inturn,that34.4%gainwillproduceastaggering$19,000increaseinreal GDPpercapitaforthenextgeneration. Were that to be distributed equally, the gain would be $76,000 annually for a family of four. Today’s politicians neednotshedtearsfortomorrow’schildren. Indeed, most of today’s children are doing well. All families in my upper middle-class neighborhood regularly enjoy a living standard better than that achieved by John D. Rockefeller Sr. at the time of my birth. His unparalleled fortune couldn’t buy what we now take for granted, whether the field is – to name just a few – transportation, entertainment, communication or medical services. Rockefeller certainly had power and fame; he couldnot,however,liveaswellasmyneighborsnowdo. Though the pie to be shared by the next generation will be far larger than today’s, how it will be divided will remain fiercely contentious. Just as is now the case, there will be struggles for the increased output of goods and services between those people in their productive years and retirees, between the healthy and the infirm, betweentheinheritorsandthe Horatio Algers,betweeninvestorsandworkersand,inparticular,betweenthosewith talentsthatarevaluedhighlybythemarketplaceandtheequallydecenthard-working Americanswholacktheskills the market prizes. Clashes of that sort have forever been with us – and will forever continue. Congress will be the battlefield;moneyandvoteswillbetheweapons.Lobbyingwillremainagrowthindustry. The good news, however, is that even members of the “losing” sides will almost certainly enjoy –as they should –farmoregoodsandservices inthefuture thantheyhaveinthepast.Thequality oftheir increased bounty will also dramatically improve. Nothing rivals the market system in producing what people want – nor, even more so, in delivering what people don’t yet know they want. My parents, when young, could not envision a television set, nor did I, in my 50s, think I needed a personal computer. Both products, once people saw what they could do, quickly revolutionized their lives. I now spend ten hours a week playing bridge online. And, as I write this letter, “search”isinvaluabletome.(I’mnotreadyfor Tinder,however.) For 240 years it’s been a terrible mistake to bet against America, and now is no time to start. America’s golden goose of commerce and innovation will continue to lay more and larger eggs. America’s social security promises willbehonoredandperhaps mademoregenerous. And,yes,America’s kidswilllivefarbetter thantheir parentsdid.   Considering thisfavorable tailwind, Berkshire (and,tobesure,agreat manyotherbusinesses) willalmost certainly prosper. The managers who succeed Charlie and me will build Berkshire’s per-share intrinsic value by following our simple blueprint of: (1) constantly improving the basic earning power of our many subsidiaries; (2) further increasing their earnings through bolt-on acquisitions; (3) benefiting from the growth of our investees; (4) repurchasing Berkshire shares when they are available at a meaningful discount from intrinsic value; and (5)makinganoccasionallargeacquisition.Managementwillalsotrytomaximizeresultsforyoubyrarely,ifever, issuing Berkshireshares. Intrinsic Business Value Asmuchas Charlieand Italkaboutintrinsicbusinessvalue,wecannottellyoupreciselywhatthatnumber isfor Berkshireshares(nor,infact,foranyotherstock).Itispossible,however,tomakeasensibleestimate.Inour 2010 annual report we laid out the three elements – one of them qualitative – that we believe are the keys to an estimationof Berkshire’sintrinsicvalue.Thatdiscussionisreproducedinfullonpages113-114. Here is an update of the two quantitative factors: In 2015 our per-share cash and investments increased 8.3% to $159,794 (with our Kraft Heinz shares stated at market value), and earnings from our many businesses – including insurance underwriting income – increased 2.1% to $12,304 per share. We exclude in the second factor the dividends and interest from the investments we hold because including them would produce a double-counting of value. In arriving at our earnings figure, we deduct all corporate overhead, interest, depreciation, amortization andminorityinterests.Incometaxes,though,arenotdeducted.Thatis,theearningsarepre-tax. Iusedtheitalicsintheparagraphabovebecauseweareforthefirsttimeincludinginsuranceunderwriting incomeinbusinessearnings.Wedidnotdothatwhenweinitiallyintroduced Berkshire’stwoquantitativepillarsof valuation because our insurance results were then heavily influenced by catastrophe coverages. If the wind didn’t blow and the earth didn’t shake, we made large profits. But a mega-catastrophe wouldproduce red ink. In order to be conservative then in stating our business earnings, weconsistently assumed that underwriting wouldbreak even overtimeandignoredanyofitsgainsorlossesinourannualcalculationofthesecondfactorofvalue. Today,ourinsuranceresultsarelikelytobemorestablethanwasthecaseadecadeortwoagobecausewe have deemphasized catastrophe coverages and greatly expanded our bread-and-butter lines of business.

Charlie and I like to see gains in both sectors, but our main goal is to build operating earnings.   Now, let’s examine the four major sectors of our operations. Each has vastly different balance sheet and incomecharacteristics fromtheothers.Sowe’llpresentthemasfourseparatebusinesses,whichishow Charlieand Iviewthem(thoughthereareimportantandenduringeconomicadvantagestohavingthemallunderoneroof).Our intent istoprovideyouwiththeinformation wewouldwishtohaveifourpositionswerereversed,withyoubeing thereportingmanagerandwetheabsenteeshareholders.(Don’tgetexcited;thisisnotaswitchweareconsidering.) Insurance Let’slookfirstatinsurance.Theproperty-casualty(“P/C”)branchofthatindustryhasbeentheenginethat has propelled our expansion since 1967, when we acquired National Indemnity and its sister company, National Fire & Marine, for $8.6 million. Today, National Indemnity is the largest property-casualty company in the world, as measured by net worth. Moreover, its intrinsic value is far in excess of the value at which it is carried on our books. One reason we were attracted to the P/C business was its financial characteristics: P/C insurers receive premiumsupfrontandpayclaimslater.Inextremecases,suchasthosearisingfromcertainworkers’compensation accidents, payments can stretch over many decades. This collect-now, pay-later model leaves P/C companies holdinglargesums–moneywecall“float”–thatwilleventuallygotoothers.Meanwhile,insurersgettoinvestthis floatfortheirownbenefit.Thoughindividualpoliciesandclaimscomeandgo,theamountoffloataninsurerholds usuallyremainsfairlystableinrelationtopremiumvolume.Consequently,asourbusinessgrows,sodoesourfloat.

This structure is by design and is a key component in the strength of Berkshire’s economic fortress. It will never be compromised. If our premiums exceed the total of our expenses and eventual losses, we register an underwriting profit thataddstotheinvestmentincomeourfloatproduces.Whensuchaprofitisearned,weenjoytheuseoffreemoney –and,betteryet,getpaidforholdingit. Unfortunately,thewishofallinsurerstoachievethishappyresultcreatesintensecompetition,sovigorous indeed that it sometimes causes the P/Cindustry as a whole to operate at a significant underwriting loss.This loss, in effect, is what the industry pays to hold its float. Competitive dynamics almost guarantee that the insurance industry, despite the float income all its companies enjoy, will continue its dismal record of earning subnormal returnsontangiblenetworthascomparedtoother Americanbusinesses.Theprolongedperiodoflowinterestrates the world is now dealing with also virtually guarantees that earnings onfloat will steadily decrease for many years to come, thereby exacerbating the profit problems of insurers. It’s agoodbetthatindustry results overthenextten years will fall short of those recorded in the past decade, particularly for those companies that specialize in reinsurance. As noted early in this report, Berkshire has now operated at an underwriting profit for 13 consecutive years,ourpre-taxgainfortheperiodhavingtotaled$26.2billion.That’snoaccident:Disciplinedriskevaluationis thedailyfocusofallofourinsurancemanagers,whoknowthatwhilefloatisvaluable,itsbenefitscanbedrowned bypoorunderwritingresults.Allinsurersgivethatmessagelipservice.At Berkshireitisareligion,Old Testament style.

Just as surely,weeachdaywritenewbusinessthatwillsoongenerateitsownclaims,addingtofloat. If our revolving float is both costless and long-enduring, which I believe it will be, the true value of this liability is dramatically less than the accounting liability.

Fortunately, that does not describe Berkshire. Charlie and I believe the true economic value of our insurance goodwill – what we would happily pay for float of similar quality were we to purchase an insurance operationpossessingit–tobefarinexcessofitshistoriccarryingvalue.Indeed,almosttheentire$15.5billionwe carry for goodwill in our insurance business was already on our books in 2000. Yet we subsequently tripled our float. Its value today is one reason – a huge reason – why we believe Berkshire’s intrinsic business value substantiallyexceedsitsbookvalue.   Berkshire’s attractive insurance economics exist only because we have some terrific managers running disciplinedoperationsthatpossesshard-to-replicatebusinessmodels.Letmetellyouaboutthemajorunits. First by float size is the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group, managed by Ajit Jain. Ajit insures risks that no one else has the desire or the capital to take on. His operation combines capacity, speed, decisiveness and, most important, brains in a manner unique in the insurance business. Yet he never exposes Berkshire to risks that areinappropriateinrelationtoourresources. Indeed, Berkshire is far more conservative in avoiding risk than most large insurers. For example, if the insuranceindustryshouldexperiencea$250billionlossfromsomemega-catastrophe –alossabouttripleanything it has ever experienced – Berkshire as a whole would likely record a significant profit for the year because of its many streams of earnings. We would also remain awash in cash and be looking for large opportunities to write business in an insurance market that might well be in disarray. Meanwhile, other major insurers and reinsurers wouldbeswimminginredink,ifnotfacinginsolvency. When Ajit entered Berkshire’s office on a Saturday in 1986, he did not have a day’s experience in the insurance business. Nevertheless, Mike Goldberg, then our manager of insurance, handed him the keys to our reinsurance business. With that move, Mike achieved sainthood: Since then, Ajit has created tens of billions of valuefor Berkshireshareholders.   Wehaveanotherreinsurancepowerhousein General Re,managedby Tad Montross. At bottom, a sound insurance operation needs to adhere to four disciplines. It must (1) understand all exposuresthatmightcauseapolicytoincurlosses;(2)conservativelyassessthelikelihoodofanyexposureactually causing a loss and the probable cost if it does; (3) set a premium that, on average, will deliver a profit after both prospective loss costs and operating expenses are covered; and (4) be willing to walk away if the appropriate premiumcan’tbeobtained. Many insurers passthefirst three tests andflunkthefourth. Theysimply can’t turntheir backonbusiness that is being eagerly written by their competitors. That old line, “The other guy is doing it, so we must as well,” spellstroubleinanybusiness,butinnonemoresothaninsurance. Tad has observed all four of the insurance commandments, and it shows in his results. General Re’s huge float has been considerably better than cost-free under his leadership, and we expect that, on average, to continue. We are particularly enthusiastic about General Re’s international life reinsurance business, which has grown consistentlyandprofitablysinceweacquiredthecompanyin1998. It can be remembered that soon after we purchased General Re, it was beset by problems that caused commentators –andmeaswell,briefly–tobelieve Ihadmadeahugemistake.Thatdayislonggone.General Re isnowagem.   Finally, there is GEICO, the insurer on which I cut my teeth 65 years ago. GEICO is managed by Tony Nicely, whojoined the company at 18and completed 54years ofservice in2015.Tonybecame CEOin1993,and sincethenthecompanyhasbeenflying.Thereisnobettermanagerthan Tony.Inthe40yearsthat I’veknownhim, hiseveryactionhasmadegreatsense.

It was clear to me that GEICO wouldsucceedbecauseitdeservedtosucceed. No one likes to buy auto insurance. Almost everyone, though, likes to drive. The insurance consequently neededisamajorexpenditureformostfamilies.Savingsmattertothem–andonlyalow-costoperationcandeliver these. Indeed, at least 40% of the people reading this letter can save money by insuring with GEICO. So stop reading–rightnow!–andgotogeico.comorcall800-368-2734. GEICO’s cost advantage is the factor that has enabled the company to gobble up market share year after year. (We ended 2015 with 11.4% of the market compared to 2.5% in 1995, when Berkshire acquired control of GEICO.)Thecompany’slowcostscreateamoat–anenduringone–thatcompetitorsareunabletocross. All the while, our gecko never tires of telling Americans how GEICO can save them important money. I love hearing the little guy deliver his message: “15 minutes could save you 15% or more on car insurance.” (Of course, there’s always a grouch in the crowd. One of my friends says he is glad that only a few animals can talk, sincetheonesthatdospeakseemunabletodiscussanysubjectbutinsurance.)   In addition to our three major insurance operations, we own a group of smaller companies that primarily write commercial coverages. In aggregate, these companies are a large, growing and valuable operation that consistently delivers an underwriting profit, usually much better than that reported by their competitors. Indeed, over the past 13 years, this group has earned $4 billion from underwriting – about 13% of its premium volume – whileincreasingitsfloatfrom$943millionto$9.9billion. Lessthanthreeyearsago,weformed Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance(“BHSI”),whichweinclude inthisgroup.Ourfirstdecisionwastoput Peter Eastwoodincharge.Thatmovewasahomerun:BHSIhasalready developed $1 billion of annual premium volume and, under Peter’s direction, is destined to become one of the world’sleading P/Cinsurers.

At BHE, meanwhile, two factors ensure the company’s ability to service its debt under all circumstances. The first is common to all utilities: recession-resistant earnings, which result from these companies offering an essential service on an exclusive basis. The second is enjoyed by few other utilities: a great and ever-widening diversityofearningsstreams,whichshield BHEfrombeingseriouslyharmedbyanysingleregulatorybody.These many sources of profit, supplemented by the inherent advantage of being owned by a strong parent, have allowed BHEanditsutilitysubsidiariestosignificantlylowertheircostofdebt.Thiseconomicfactbenefitsbothusandour customers.

Both BHE and BNSF have been leaders in pursuing planet-friendly technology.

(Additional wind projects to which we are committed will take that figureto58%in2017.) BNSF, like other Class I railroads, uses only a single gallon of diesel fuel to move a ton of freight almost 500 miles. That makes the railroads four times as fuel-efficient as trucks!

Our income and expense data conforming to GAAP is on page 38. In contrast, the operating expense figures above are non-GAAP because they exclude some purchase-accounting items (primarily the amortization of certain intangible assets). We present the data in this manner because Charlie and I believe the adjusted numbers more accurately reflect the true economic expenses and profits of the businesses aggregated in the table than do GAAPfigures. Iwon’texplainalloftheadjustments–somearetinyandarcane–butseriousinvestorsshouldunderstand the disparate nature of intangible assets. Some truly deplete in value over time, while others in no way lose value. For software, as a big example, amortization charges are very real expenses. Conversely, the concept of recording charges against otherintangibles, suchascustomer relationships, arises from purchase-accounting rulesandclearly does not reflect economic reality. GAAP accounting draws no distinction between the two types of charges. Both, that is, are recorded as expenses when earnings are calculated – even though, from an investor’s viewpoint, they couldnotdiffermore. In the GAAP-compliant figures we show on page 38, amortization charges of $1.1 billion have been deducted as expenses. We would call about 20% of these “real,” the rest not. The “non-real” charges, once non- existent at Berkshire, have become significant because of the many acquisitions we have made. Non-real amortizationchargesarelikelytoclimbfurtherasweacquiremorecompanies. Thetableonpage55givesyouthecurrentstatusofourintangibleassetsascalculatedby GAAP.Wenow have $6.8 billion left of amortizable intangibles, of which $4.1 billion will be expensed over the next five years. Eventually, of course, every dollar of these “assets” will be charged off. When that happens, reported earnings increaseeveniftrueearningsareflat.(Mygifttomysuccessor.) I suggest that you ignore a portion of GAAP amortization costs.

And, if real and recurring expenses don’t belong in the calculation of earnings,whereintheworlddotheybelong? Wall Street analysts often play their part in this charade, too, parroting the phony, compensation-ignoring “earnings” figures fed them bymanagements. Maybe the offending analysts don’t knowany better. Ormaybethey fear losing “access” to management. Or maybe they are cynical, telling themselves that since everyone else is playing the game, why shouldn’t they go along with it. Whatever their reasoning, these analysts are guilty of propagatingmisleadingnumbersthatcandeceiveinvestors.

Let’s get back to our many manufacturing, service and retailing operations, which sell products ranging from lollipops to jet airplanes. Some of this sector’s businesses, measured by earnings on unleveraged net tangible assets, enjoy terrific economics, producing profits that run from 25% after-tax to far more than 100%. Others generategoodreturnsintheareaof12%to20%. A few, however – these are serious mistakes I made in my job of capital allocation – have very poor returns. In most of these cases, I was wrong in my evaluation of the economic dynamics of the company or the industry in which it operates, and weare nowpaying the price for my misjudgments.

You can nevertheless find a good bit of detail about many of our operationsonpages88-91. Financeand Financial Products Our three leasing and rental operations are conducted by CORT (furniture), XTRA (semi-trailers), and Marmon (primarily tank cars but also freight cars, intermodal tank containers and cranes). These companies are industry leaders and have substantially increased their earnings as the American economy has gained strength. At each of the three, we have invested more money in new equipment than have many of our competitors, and that’s paidoff.Dealingfromstrengthisoneof Berkshire’senduringadvantages. Kevin Clayton has again delivered an industry-leading performance at Clayton Homes, the second-largest homebuilderin America.Lastyear,thecompanysold34,397homes,about45%ofthemanufacturedhomesbought by Americans.Incontrast,thecompanywasnumberthreeinthefield,witha14%share,when Berkshirepurchased itin2003. Manufactured homes allow the American dream of home ownership to be achieved by lower-income citizens: Around 70% of new homes costing $150,000 or less come from our industry. About 46% of Clayton’s homesaresoldthroughthe331storesweourselvesownandoperate.Mostof Clayton’sremainingsalesaremadeto 1,395independentretailers. Key to Clayton’s operation is its $12.8 billion mortgage portfolio. We originate about 35% of all mortgages on manufactured homes. About 37% of our mortgage portfolio emanates from our retail operation, with the balance primarily originated by independent retailers, some of which sell our homes while others market only thehomesofourcompetitors. Lenders other than Clayton have come and gone. With Berkshire’s backing, however, Clayton steadfastly financed home buyers throughout the panic days of 2008-2009. Indeed, during that period, Clayton used precious capitaltofinancedealerswhodidnotsellourhomes.Thefundswesuppliedto Goldman Sachsand General Electric at that time produced headlines; the funds Berkshire quietly delivered to Clayton both made home ownership possibleforthousandsoffamiliesandkeptmanynon-Claytondealersalive. Our retail outlets, employing simple language and large type, consistently inform home buyers of alternative sources for financing –most of it comingfrom local banks–andalwayssecure acknowledgments from customers that this information has been received and read. (The form we use is reproduced in its actual size on page119.) Mortgage-origination practices are of great importance to both the borrower and to society. There is no question that reckless practices in home lending played a major role in bringing on the financial panic of 2008, which in turn led to the Great Recession. In the years preceding the meltdown, a destructive and often corrupt pattern of mortgage creation flourished whereby (1) an originator in, say, California would make loans and (2) promptly sell them to an investment or commercial bank in, say, New York, which would package many mortgages to serve as collateral for a dizzyingly complicated array of mortgage-backed securities to be (3) sold to unwittinginstitutionsaroundtheworld. As if these sins weren’t sufficient to create an unholy mess, imaginative investment bankers sometimes concoctedasecondlayerofsliced-upfinancingwhosevaluedependedonthejunkierportionsofprimaryofferings. (When Wall Street gets “innovative,” watch out!) While that wasgoing on,I described this “doubling-up” practice as requiring an investor to read tens of thousands of pages of mind-numbing prose to evaluate a single security beingoffered. Both the originator and the packager of these financings had no skin in the game and were driven by volume and mark-ups. Many housing borrowers joined the party as well, blatantly lying on their loan applications whilemortgage originators lookedtheotherway.Naturally, thegamiest credits generated themostprofits.Smooth Wall Street salesmen garnered millions annually by manufacturing products that their customers were unable to understand. (It’s also questionable as to whether the major rating agencies were capable of evaluating the more complexstructures.Butratethemtheydid.) Barney Frank,perhapsthemostfinancially-savvy memberof Congressduringthepanic,recentlyassessed the2010Dodd-Frank Act,saying,“Theonemajorweaknessthat I’veseenintheimplementation wasthisdecision by the regulators not to impose risk retention on all residential mortgages.” Today, some legislators and commentatorscontinuetoadvocatea1%-to-5%retentionbytheoriginatorasawaytoalignitsinterestswiththatof theultimatelenderormortgageguarantor. At Clayton,ourrisk retention was,andis,100%.Whenweoriginate amortgage wekeepit(leaving aside the few that qualify for a government guarantee). When we make mistakes in granting credit, we therefore pay a price – a hefty price that dwarfs any profit we realized upon the original sale of the home. Last year we had to forecloseon8,444manufactured-housingmortgagesatacosttousof$157million.

We will lose money then, and our borrower will lose his downpayment(thoughhismortgagepaymentsduringhistimeofoccupancymayhavebeenwellunderrentalrates for comparable quarters). Nevertheless, despite the low FICO scores and income of our borrowers, their payment behaviorduringthe Great Recessionwasfarbetterthanthatprevailinginmanymortgagepoolspopulatedbypeople earningmultiplesofourtypicalborrower’sincome. The strong desire of our borrowers to have a home of their own is one reason we’ve done well with our mortgageportfolio.Equallyimportant,wehavefinancedmuchoftheportfoliowithfloating-ratedebtorwithshort- term fixed-rate debt. Consequently, the incredibly low short-term rates of recent years have provided us a constantly-wideningspreadbetweenourinterestcostsandtheincomewederivefromourmortgageportfolio,which bearsfixedrates.(Incidentally,wewouldhaveenjoyedsimilarmarginshadwesimplyboughtlong-termbondsand financedthepositioninsomeshort-termmanner.) Normally, it is risky business to lend long at fixed rates and borrow short as we have been doing at Clayton. Over the years, some important financial institutions have gone broke doing that. At Berkshire, however, we possess a natural offset in that our businesses always maintain at least $20 billion in cash-equivalents that earn short-termrates.Moreoften,ourshort-terminvestmentsareinthe$40billionto$60billionrange.Ifwehave,say, $60billioninvestedat 1⁄ 4%orless,asharpmovetohighershort-termrateswouldbringbenefitstousfarexceeding the higher financing costs we would incur in funding Clayton’s $13 billion mortgage portfolio. In banking terms, Berkshireis–andalwayswillbe–heavilyasset-sensitiveandwillconsequentlybenefitfromrisinginterestrates. Let me talk about one subject of which I am particularly proud, that having to do with regulation. The Great Recession caused mortgage originators, servicers and packagers to come under intense scrutiny and to be assessedmanybillionsofdollarsinfinesandpenalties.

Productivityand Prosperity Earlier, I told you how our partners at Kraft Heinz root out inefficiencies, thereby increasing output per hour of employment. That kind of improvement has been the secret sauce of America’s remarkable gains in living standards since the nation’s founding in 1776. Unfortunately, the label of “secret” is appropriate: Too few Americansfullygraspthelinkagebetweenproductivityandprosperity.Toseethatconnection,let’slookfirstatthe country’smostdramaticexample–farming–andlaterexaminethree Berkshire-specificareas. In1900,America’scivilianworkforcenumbered28million.Ofthese,11million,astaggering40%ofthe total, worked in farming. The leading crop then, as now, was corn. About 90 million acres were devoted to its productionandtheyieldperacrewas30bushels,foratotaloutputof2.7billionbushelsannually. Then came the tractor and one innovation after another that revolutionized such keys to farm productivity as planting, harvesting, irrigation, fertilization and seed quality. Today, we devote about 85 million acres to corn. Productivity,however,hasimprovedyieldstomorethan150bushelsperacre,foranannualoutputof13-14billion bushels.Farmershavemadesimilargainswithotherproducts. Increased yields, though, are only half the story: The huge increases in physical output have been accompanied by a dramatic reduction in the number of farm laborers (“human input”). Today about three million people work on farms, a tiny 2% of our 158-million-person work force. Thus, improved farming methods have allowedtensofmillionsofpresent-dayworkerstoutilizetheirtimeandtalentsinotherendeavors,areallocationof human resources that enables Americans of today to enjoy huge quantities of non-farm goods and services they wouldotherwiselack. It’s easy to look back over the 115-year span and realize how extraordinarily beneficial agricultural innovations havebeen–notjustforfarmers but,morebroadly,forourentiresociety.Wewouldnothaveanything closetothe Americawenowknowhadwestifledthoseimprovementsinproductivity.(Itwasfortunatethathorses couldn’tvote.)Onaday-to-daybasis,however,talkofthe“greatergood”musthaverunghollowtofarmhandswho lost their jobs to machines that performed routine tasks far more efficiently than humans ever could. We will examinethisflip-sidetoproductivitygainslaterinthissection. For the moment, however, let’s move on to three stories of efficiencies that have had major consequences for Berkshiresubsidiaries.Similartransformationshavebeencommonplacethroughout Americanbusiness. ‹ In 1947, shortly after the end of World War II, the American workforce totaled 44 million. About 1.35 million workers were employed in the railroad industry. The revenue ton-miles of freight moved by Class Irailroadsthatyeartotaled655billion. By 2014, Class I railroads carried 1.85 trillion ton-miles, an increase of 182%, while employing only 187,000 workers, a reduction of 86% since 1947. (Some of this change involved passenger-related employees, but most of the workforce reduction came on the freight side.) As a result of this staggering improvement in productivity, the inflation-adjusted price for moving a ton-mile of freight has fallen by 55%since1947,adropsavingshippersabout$90billionannuallyincurrentdollars. Anotherstartling statistic: Ifittookasmanypeoplenowtomovefreight asitdidin1947,wewouldneed well over three million railroad workers to handle present volumes. (Of course, that level of employment wouldraisefreightchargesbyalot;consequently,nothingclosetotoday’svolumewouldactuallymove.) Ourown BNSFwasformed in 1995bya merger between Burlington Northern and Santa Fe.In 1996,the mergedcompany’sfirstfullyearofoperation,411millionton-milesoffreightweretransportedby45,000 employees.Lastyearthecomparablefigureswere702millionton-miles(plus71%)and47,000employees (plus only 4%). That dramatic gain inproductivity benefits bothownersandshippers. Safetyat BNSFhas improvedaswell:Reportableinjurieswere2.04per200,000man-hoursin1996andhavesincefallenmore than50%to0.95. ‹ A bit more than a century ago, the auto was invented, and around it formed an industry that insures cars and their drivers. Initially, this business was written through traditional insurance agencies – the kind dealing infireinsurance.Thisagency-centric approachincludedhighcommissions andotherunderwriting expenses that consumed about 40¢ of the premium dollar. Strong local agencies were then in the driver’s seat because they represented multiple insurers and could play one company off against another when commissions were being negotiated. Cartel-like pricing prevailed, and all involved were doing fine – exceptfortheconsumer. Andthensome Americaningenuitycameintoplay:G.J.Mecherle,afarmerfrom Merna,Illinois,cameup with the idea of a captive sales force that would sell theinsurance products ofonlyasingle company.His baby was christened State Farm Mutual. The company cut commissions and expenses – moves that permitted lower prices – and soon became a powerhouse. For many decades, State Farm has been the runaway volume leader in both auto and homeowner’s insurance. Allstate, which also operated with a direct distribution model, was long the runner-up. Both State Farm and Allstate have had underwriting expensesofabout25%. In the early 1930s, another contender, United Services Auto Association (“USAA”), a mutual-like company,waswritingautoinsuranceformilitaryofficersonadirect-to-the-customerbasis.Thismarketing innovationrosefromaneedthatmilitarypersonnelhadtobuyinsurancethatwouldstaywiththemasthey movedfrombasetobase.Thatwasbusinessoflittleinteresttolocalinsuranceagencies,whichwantedthe steadyrenewalsthatcamefrompermanentresidents. The direct distribution method of USAA,as it happened, incurred lower costs than those enjoyed by State Farmand Allstateandthereforedeliveredanevengreaterbargaintocustomers.Thatmade Leoand Lillian Goodwin, employees of USAA, dream of broadening the target market for its direct distribution model beyond military officers. In 1936, starting with $100,000 of capital, they incorporated Government Employees Insurance Co.(latercompressingthismouthfulto GEICO). Their fledgling did $238,000 of auto insurance business in 1937, its first full year. Last year GEICO did $22.6 billion, more than double the volume of USAA. (Though the early bird gets the worm, the second mouse gets the cheese.) GEICO’s underwriting expenses in 2015 were 14.7% of premiums, with USAA being the only large company to achieve a lower percentage. (GEICO is fully as efficient as USAA but spendsconsiderablymoreonadvertisingaimedatpromotinggrowth.) With the price advantage GEICO’slowcosts allow, it’s not surprising that several yearsagothecompany seized the number twospotinautoinsurance from Allstate. GEICOisalsogaininggroundon State Farm, though it is still far ahead of us in volume. On August 30, 2030 – my 100th birthday – I plan to announce that GEICOhastakenoverthetopspot.Markyourcalendar. GEICO employs about 34,000 people to serve its 14 million policyholders. I can only guess at the workforce it would require to serve a similar number of policyholders under the agency system. I believe, however,thatthenumberwouldbeatleast60,000,acombinationofwhattheinsurerwouldneedindirect employmentandthepersonnelrequiredatsupportingagencies. ‹ In its electric utility business, our Berkshire Hathaway Energy (“BHE”) operates within a changing economic model. Historically, the survival of a local electric companydidnotdependonits efficiency. In fact,a“sloppy”operationcoulddojustfinefinancially. That’s because utilities were usually the sole supplier of a needed product and were allowed to price at a levelthatgavethemaprescribedreturnuponthecapitaltheyemployed.Thejokeintheindustrywasthata utility was the only business that would automatically earn more money byredecorating the boss’s office. Andsome CEOsranthingsaccordingly. That’s all changing. Today, society has decided that federally-subsidized wind and solar generation is in our country’s long-term interest. Federal tax credits are used to implement this policy, support that makes renewablesprice-competitiveincertaingeographies.Thosetaxcredits,orothergovernment-mandatedhelp forrenewables,mayeventuallyerodetheeconomicsoftheincumbentutility,particularlyifitisahigh-cost operator.BHE’slong-established emphasisonefficiency–evenwhenthecompanydidn’tneedittoattain authorized earnings – leaves us particularly competitive in today’s market (and, more important, in tomorrow’saswell).

The safety record of our Iowa utility is also outstanding. It had.79 injuries per 100 employees in 2015 comparedtotherateof7.0experiencedbythepreviousownerintheyearbeforeweboughttheoperation. In 2006 BHE purchased Pacifi Corp, which operated primarily in Oregon and Utah. The year before our purchase Pacifi Corp employed 6,750 people and produced 52.6 million megawatt-hours. Last year the numberswere5,700employeesand56.3millionmegawatt-hours.Here,too,safetyimproveddramatically, with the accident-rate-per-100-employees falling from 3.4 in 2005 to.85 in 2015. In safety, BHE now ranksintheindustry’stopdecile. Those outstanding performances explain why BHE is welcomed by regulators when it proposes to buy a utility in their jurisdiction. The regulators know the company will run an efficient, safe and reliable operationandalsoarrivewithunlimitedcapitaltofundwhateverprojectsmakesense.(BHEhasneverpaid adividendto Berkshiresinceweassumedownership.Noinvestor-ownedutilityin Americacomescloseto matching BHE’senthusiasmforreinvestment.)   Theproductivitygainsthat I’vejustspelledout–andcountlessothersthathavebeenachievedin America – have delivered awesome benefits to society. That’s the reason our citizens, as a whole, have enjoyed – and will continuetoenjoy–majorgainsinthegoodsandservicestheyreceive. To this thought there are offsets. First, the productivity gains achieved in recent years have largely benefitted the wealthy. Second, productivity gains frequently cause upheaval: Both capital and labor can pay a terriblepricewheninnovationornewefficienciesupendtheirworlds. We need shed no tears for the capitalists (whether they be private owners or an army of public shareholders). It’s their job to take care of themselves. When large rewards can flow to investors from good decisions, these parties should not be spared the losses produced by wrong choices. Moreover, investors who diversify widely and simply sit tight with their holdings are certain to prosper: In America, gains from winning investments have always far more than offset the losses from clunkers. (During the 20th Century, the Dow Jones Industrial Average–anindexfundofsorts–soaredfrom66to11,497,withitscomponentcompaniesallthewhile payingever-increasingdividends.) A long-employed worker faces a different equation. When innovation and the market system interact to produce efficiencies, many workers may be rendered unnecessary, their talents obsolete. Some can find decent employmentelsewhere;forothers,thatisnotanoption. When low-cost competition drove shoe production to Asia, our once-prosperous Dexter operation folded, putting 1,600 employees in a small Maine town out of work. Many were past the point in life at which they could learn another trade. We lost our entire investment, which we could afford, but many workers lost a livelihood they couldnotreplace.Thesamescenariounfoldedinslow-motionatouroriginal New Englandtextileoperation,which struggledfor20yearsbeforeexpiring.Manyolderworkersatour New Bedfordplant,asapoignantexample,spoke Portugueseandknewlittle,ifany,English.Theyhadno Plan B. The answer in such disruptions is not the restraining or outlawing of actions that increase productivity.

Thesolution,rather,isavarietyofsafetynetsaimedatprovidingadecentlifeforthosewhoarewillingto work but find their specific talents judged of small value because of market forces. (I personally favor a reformed andexpanded Earned Income Tax Creditthatwouldtrytomakesure Americaworksforthosewillingtowork.)The price of achieving ever-increasing prosperity for the great majority of Americans should not be penury for the unfortunate. Important Risks We, like all public companies, are required by the SEC to annually catalog “risk factors” in our 10-K. I can’tremember,however,aninstancewhenreadinga10-K’s“risk”sectionhashelpedmeinevaluatingabusiness. That’s not because the identified risks aren’t real. The truly important risks, however, are usually well known. Beyond that, a 10-K’s catalog of risks is seldom of aid in assessing: (1) the probability of the threatening event actually occurring; (2) the range of costs if it does occur; and (3) the timing of the possible loss.

None of these problems, however, is crucial to Berkshire’s long-term well-being. When we took over the company in 1965, its risks could have been encapsulated in a single sentence: “The northern textile business in which all of our capital resides is destined for recurring losses and will eventually disappear.” That development, however,wasnodeathknell.Wesimplyadapted.Andwewillcontinuetodoso. Every day Berkshire managers are thinking about how they can better compete in an always-changing world.Justasvigorously,Charlieand Ifocusonwhereasteadystreamoffundsshouldbedeployed.Inthatrespect, we possess a major advantage over one-industry companies, whose options are far more limited. I firmly believe that Berkshire has the money, talent and culture to plow through the sort of adversities I’ve itemized above – and manymore–andtoemergewithever-greaterearningpower. There is, however, one clear, present and enduring danger to Berkshire against which Charlie and I are powerless. That threat to Berkshire is also the major threat our citizenry faces: a “successful” (as defined by the aggressor)cyber,biological,nuclearorchemicalattackonthe United States.Thatisarisk Berkshireshareswithall of Americanbusiness. The probability of such mass destruction in any given year is likely very small. It’s been more than 70 yearssince Idelivereda Washington Postnewspaperheadliningthefactthatthe United Stateshaddroppedthefirst atomic bomb.

Nevertheless,what’sasmallprobabilityinashortperiodapproachescertaintyinthelongerrun.(Ifthereis only one chance in thirty of an event occurring in a given year, the likelihood of it occurring at least once in a century is 96.6%.)

Nooneknowswhat“thedayafter”willlooklike.Ithink,however,that Einstein’s1949appraisalremains apt:“Iknownotwithwhatweapons World War IIIwillbefought,but World War IVwillbefoughtwithsticksand stones.”   I am writing this section because we have a proxy proposal regarding climate change to consider at this year’s annualmeeting.

Call this Noah’s Law: If an ark may be essential for survival, begin building it today, no matter how cloudlesstheskiesappear. It’s understandable that the sponsor of the proxy proposal believes Berkshire is especially threatened by climate change because we are a huge insurer, covering all sorts of risks. The sponsor may worry that property losseswillskyrocketbecauseofweatherchanges.Andsuchworriesmight,infact,bewarrantedifwewroteten-or twenty-year policies at fixed prices. But insurance policies are customarily written for one year and repriced annuallytoreflectchangingexposures.Increasedpossibilitiesoflosstranslatepromptlyintoincreasedpremiums. Think back to 1951 when I first became enthused about GEICO.

Over the years, inflation has caused a huge increase in the cost of repairing both the cars and the humans involved in accidents. But these increased costs have been promptly matched by increased premiums. So, paradoxically, the upward march in loss costs has made insurance companies far more valuable. If costs had remainedunchanged,Berkshirewouldnowownanautoinsurerdoing$600millionofbusinessannuallyratherthan onedoing$23billion. Up to now, climate change has not produced more frequent nor more costly hurricanes nor other weather- related events covered by insurance.

As a citizen, you may understandably find climate change keeping you up nights. As a homeowner in a low-lying area, you may wish to consider moving. But when you are thinking only as a shareholder of a major insurer,climatechangeshouldnotbeonyourlistofworries. The Annual Meeting Charlie and I have finally decided to enter the 21st Century. Our annual meeting this year will be webcast worldwide in its entirety. To view the meeting, simply go to https://finance.yahoo.com/brklivestream at 9 a.m. Central Daylight Time on Saturday, April 30th.

When I was a teenager – in my one brief flirtation with honest labor – I delivered about 500,000 papers. So I think I’m pretty good at this game. Challenge me! Humiliate me! Knock me down a peg! The papers will run 36 to 42 pages, and youmust fold them yourself(norubberbandsallowed). The competition begins at 7:15, when contestants will make preliminary tosses. The eight throws judged mostaccurate –fourmadebycontestants 12orunder,andfourmadebytheolderset–willcompeteagainstmeat 7:45. The young challengers will each receive a prize. But the older ones will have to beat me to take anything home. And be sure to check out the Clayton home itself. It can be purchased for $78,900, fully installed on land you provide. In past years, we’ve made many sales on the meeting day. Kevin Clayton will be on hand with his orderbook. At 8:30 a.m., a new Berkshire movie will be shown. An hour later, we will start the question-and-answer period, which (including a break for lunch at Century Link’s stands) will last until 3:30 p.m. After a short recess, Charlie and I will convene the annual meeting at 3:45p.m.Thisbusiness session typically lasts onlyahalfhouror soandcansafelybeskippedbythosecravingalittlelast-minuteshopping.

Airlines have sometimes jacked up prices for the Berkshire weekend. If you are coming from far away, compare the cost of flying to Kansas City vs. Omaha.

The savings for a couple could run to $1,000ormore.Spendthatmoneywithus. At Nebraska Furniture Mart, located on a 77-acre site on 72nd Street between Dodge and Pacific, we will again be having “Berkshire Weekend” discount pricing. Last year in the weekencompassing the meeting, thestore did a record $44,239,493 of business. If you repeat that figure to a retailer, he is not going to believe you. (An average week for NFM’s Omaha store – the highest-volume home furnishings store in the United States except for ournew Dallasstore–isabout$9million.)

The journalists and their e- mail addresses are: Carol Loomis, the preeminent business journalist of her time, who may be e-mailed at loomisbrk@gmail.com; Becky Quick, of CNBC, at Berkshire Questions@cnbc.com; and Andrew Ross Sorkin, of The New York Times,atarsorkin@nytimes.com.

(In your e-mail, let the journalist know if you would like your name mentioned if your questionisasked.) An accompanying set of questions will be asked by three analysts who follow Berkshire. This year the insurance specialist will be Cliff Gallant of Nomura Securities. Questions that deal with our non-insurance operations will come from Jonathan Brandt of Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb and Gregg Warren of Morningstar. Our hopeisthattheanalysts andjournalists willaskquestions that addtoourowners’understandingandknowledgeof theirinvestment. Neither Charlie nor I will get so much as a clue about the questions headed our way. Some will be tough, forsure,andthat’s thewaywelikeit.Multi-part questions aren’t allowed; wewanttogiveasmanyquestioners as possibleashotatus. All told we expect at least 54 questions, which will allow for six from each analyst and journalist and for 18fromtheaudience.(Lastyearwehad64intotal.)Thequestionersfromtheaudiencewillbechosenbymeansof 11 drawings that will take place at 8:15 a.m. on the morning of the annual meeting. Each of the 11 microphones installedinthearenaandmainoverflowroomwillhost,sotospeak,adrawing. While I’m on the subject of our owners’ gaining knowledge, let me remind you that Charlie and I believe all shareholders should simultaneously have access to new information that Berkshire releases and, if possible, should also have adequate time to digest and analyze it before any trading takes place. That’s why we try to issue financial data late on Fridays or early on Saturdays and why our annual meeting is always held on a Saturday. We donotfollowthecommonpracticeoftalkingone-on-onewithlargeinstitutionalinvestorsoranalysts,treatingthem insteadaswedoallothershareholders.Thereisnoonemoreimportanttousthantheshareholderoflimitedmeans whotrustsuswithasubstantialportionofhissavings.   Forgoodreason,Iregularlyextoltheaccomplishmentsofouroperatingmanagers.Theyaretruly All-Stars who run their businesses as if they were the only asset owned by their families. I also believe the mindset of our managerstobeasshareholder-orientedascanbefoundintheuniverseoflargepublicly-ownedcompanies.Mostof our managers have no financial need to work. The joy of hitting business “home runs” means as much to them as theirpaycheck. Equally important, however, are the 24 men and women who work with me at our corporate office. This group efficiently deals with a multitude of SEC and other regulatory requirements, files a 30,400-page Federal income tax return – that’s up 6,000 pages from the prior year! – oversees the filing of 3,530 state tax returns, respondstocountless shareholder andmedia inquiries, getsouttheannualreport, prepares forthecountry’slargest annualmeeting,coordinatesthe Board’sactivities,fact-checksthisletter–andthelistgoesonandon. They handle all of these business tasks cheerfully and with unbelievable efficiency, making my life easy andpleasant. Theirefforts gobeyondactivities strictly related to Berkshire: Lastyear,forexample, theydealt with the 40 universities (selected from 200 applicants) who sent students to Omaha for a Q&A day with me. They also handle all kinds of requests that I receive, arrange my travel, and even get me hamburgers and french fries (smothered in Heinz ketchup, of course) for lunch. No CEO has it better; I truly do feel like tap dancing to work everyday.Infact,myjobbecomesmorefuneveryyear.
