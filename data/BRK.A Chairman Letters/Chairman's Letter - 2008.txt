These once-unthinkable dosages will almost certainly bring on unwelcome aftereffects. Their precise nature is anyone’s guess, though one likely consequence is an onslaught of inflation. Moreover, major industries have become dependent on Federal assistance, and they will be followed by cities and states bearing mind-boggling requests.

In 75% of those years, the S&P stocks recorded a gain.Iwouldguessthataroughlysimilarpercentageofyearswillbepositiveinthenext44.Butneither Charlie Munger, my partner in running Berkshire, nor I can predict the winning and losing years in advance.

Ingoodyearsandbad,Charlieand Isimplyfocusonfourgoals: (1) maintaining Berkshire’s Gibraltar-like financial position, which features huge amounts of excess liquidity, near-term obligations that are modest, and dozens of sources of earnings andcash; (2) widening the “moats” aroundouroperating businesses that givethem durable competitive advantages; (3) acquiringanddevelopingnewandvariedstreamsofearnings; (4) expandingandnurturingthecadreofoutstandingoperatingmanagerswho,overtheyears, havedelivered Berkshireexceptionalresults.

In aggregate, however, our manufacturing, service and retail businessesearnedsubstantialsumsandmostofthem–particularly thelargerones–continuetostrengthentheir competitive positions. Moreover, we are fortunate that Berkshire’s two most important businesses – our insurance and utility groups – produce earnings that are not correlated to those of the general economy. Both businessesdeliveredoutstandingresultsin2008andhaveexcellentprospects. As predicted in last year’s report, the exceptional underwriting profits that our insurance businesses realizedin2007werenotrepeatedin2008.Nevertheless,theinsurancegroupdeliveredanunderwritinggainfor thesixthconsecutiveyear.Thismeansthatour$58.5billionofinsurance“float”–moneythatdoesn’tbelongto us but that we hold and invest for our own benefit – cost us less than zero. In fact, wewere paid $2.8billion to holdourfloatduring2008.Charlieand Ifindthisenjoyable. Over time, most insurers experience a substantial underwriting loss, which makes their economics far different from ours. Of course, we too will experience underwriting losses in some years. But we have the best groupofmanagersintheinsurancebusiness,andinmostcasestheyoverseeentrenchedandvaluablefranchises. Considering these strengths, I believe that we will earn an underwriting profit over the years and that our float will therefore cost us nothing. Our insurance operation, the core business of Berkshire, is an economic powerhouse. Charlie and I are equally enthusiastic about our utility business, which had record earnings last year and is poised for future gains. Dave Sokol and Greg Abel, the managers of this operation, have achieved results unmatched elsewhere in the utility industry. I love it when they come up with new projects because in this capital-intensive businesstheseventuresareoftenlarge.Suchprojectsoffer Berkshiretheopportunitytoputout substantialsumsatdecentreturns. Things also went well on the capital-allocation front last year. Berkshire is always a buyer of both businesses and securities, and the disarray in markets gave us a tailwind in our purchases. When investing, pessimismisyourfriend,euphoriatheenemy. In our insurance portfolios, we made three large investments on terms that would be unavailable in normal markets. These should add about $11⁄ 2 billion pre-tax to Berkshire’s annual earnings and offer possibilities for capital gains as well. We also closed on our Marmon acquisition (we own 64% of the company nowandwillpurchaseitsremainingstockoverthenextsixyears).Additionally,certainofoursubsidiariesmade “tuck-in”acquisitionsthatwillstrengthentheircompetitivepositionsandearnings. That’sthegoodnews.Butthere’sanotherlesspleasantreality:During2008Ididsomedumbthingsin investments. I made at least one major mistake of commission and several lesser ones that also hurt. I will tell you more about these later. Furthermore, I made some errors of omission, sucking my thumb when new facts cameinthatshouldhavecausedmetore-examinemythinkingandpromptlytakeaction. Additionally, the market value of the bonds and stocks that we continue to hold suffered a significant declinealongwiththegeneralmarket.Thisdoesnotbother Charlieandme.Indeed,weenjoysuchpricedeclines if we have funds available to increase our positions. Long ago, Ben Graham taught me that “Price is what you pay; value is what you get.” Whether we’re talking about socks or stocks, I like buying quality merchandise whenitismarkeddown. Yardsticks Berkshire has two major areas of value. The first is our investments: stocks, bonds and cash equivalents. At yearend those totaled $122 billion (not counting the investments held by our finance and utility operations, which we assign to our second bucket of value). About $58.5 billion of that total is funded by our insurancefloat. Berkshire’ssecondcomponentofvalueisearningsthatcomefromsourcesotherthaninvestmentsand insurance. These earnings are delivered by our 67 non-insurance companies, itemized on page 96.

We like buying underpriced securities, but welike buyingfairly-pricedoperatingbusinessesevenmore. Now, let’s take a look at the four major operating sectors of Berkshire. Each of these has vastly different balance sheet and income account characteristics. Therefore, lumping them together, as is done in standardfinancialstatements,impedesanalysis.Sowe’llpresentthemasfourseparatebusinesses,whichishow Charlieand Iviewthem. Regulated Utility Business Berkshire has an 87.4% (diluted) interest in Mid American Energy Holdings, which owns a wide variety of utility operations. The largest of these are (1) Yorkshire Electricity and Northern Electric, whose 3.8 million end users make it the U.K.’s third largest distributor of electricity; (2) Mid American Energy, which serves 723,000 electric customers, primarily in Iowa; (3) Pacific Power and Rocky Mountain Power, serving about 1.7 million electric customers in six western states; and (4) Kern River and Northern Natural pipelines, whichcarryabout9%ofthenaturalgasconsumedinthe U.S. Our partners in ownership of Mid American are its two terrific managers, Dave Sokol and Greg Abel, and my long-time friend, Walter Scott. It’s unimportant how many votes each party has; we make major moves only when we are unanimous in thinking them wise. Nine years of working with Dave, Greg and Walter have reinforcedmyoriginalbelief:Berkshirecouldn’thavebetterpartners. Somewhat incongruously, Mid American alsoownsthesecondlargest real estate brokerage firm inthe U.S., Home Services of America. This company operates through 21 locally-branded firms that have 16,000 agents. Last year was a terrible year for home sales, and 2009 looks no better.

Indeed, Mid American has not paid a dividend since Berkshire bought into the company in early 2000.Its earnings have instead been reinvested to develop the utility systems our customers require and deserve. In exchange,wehavebeenallowedtoearnafairreturnonthehugesumswehaveinvested.It’sagreatpartnership forallconcerned.   Ourlong-avowedgoalistobethe“buyerofchoice”forbusinesses–particularlythosebuiltandowned by families. The way to achieve this goal is to deserve it. That means we must keep our promises; avoid leveraging upacquired businesses; grant unusual autonomy to our managers; and hold the purchased companies throughthickandthin(thoughwepreferthickandthicker). Our record matches our rhetoric. Most buyers competing against us, however, follow a different path. For them, acquisitions are “merchandise.” Before the ink dries on their purchase contracts, these operators are contemplating “exit strategies.” We have a decided advantage, therefore, when we encounter sellers who truly careaboutthefutureoftheirbusinesses. Some years back our competitors were known as “leveraged-buyout operators.” But LBO became a badname.Soin Orwellianfashion,thebuyoutfirmsdecidedtochangetheirmoniker.Whattheydidnotchange, though, were the essential ingredients of their previous operations, including their cherished fee structures and loveofleverage. Their new label became “private equity,” a name that turns the facts upside-down: A purchase of a business by these firms almost invariably results in dramatic reductions in the equity portion of the acquiree’s capital structure compared tothatpreviously existing. Anumberoftheseacquirees,purchasedonlytwotothree years ago, are now in mortal danger because of the debt piled on them by their private-equity buyers.

In the regulated utility field there are no large family-owned businesses. Here, Berkshire hopes to be the “buyer of choice” of regulators. It is they, rather than selling shareholders, who judge the fitness of purchaserswhentransactionsareproposed. Thereisnohidingyourhistory whenyoustandbefore theseregulators.

General Re, our large international reinsurer, also had an outstanding year in 2008. Some time back, thecompanyhadseriousproblems(which Itotallyfailedtodetectwhenwepurchaseditinlate1998).By2001, when Joe Brandon took over as CEO, assisted by his partner, Tad Montross, General Re’s culture had further deteriorated, exhibiting a loss of discipline in underwriting, reserving and expenses. After Joe and Tad took charge, these problems were decisively and successfully addressed. Today General Re has regained its luster. Last spring Joe stepped down, and Tad became CEO. Charlie and I are grateful to Joe for righting the ship and arecertainthat,with Tad,General Re’sfutureisinthebestofhands. Reinsurance is a business of long-term promises, sometimes extending for fifty years or more. This past year has retaught clients a crucial principle: A promise is nobetter than the person or institution making it. That’swhere General Reexcels:Itistheonlyreinsurerthatisbackedbyan AAAcorporation.Ben Franklinonce said,“It’sdifficultforanemptysacktostandupright.”That’snoworryfor General Reclients. Ourthird major insurance operation is Ajit Jain’s reinsurance division, headquartered in Stamford and staffed by only 31 employees. This may be one of the most remarkable businesses in the world, hard to characterizebuteasytoadmire. From year to year, Ajit’s business is never the same.

So I did the logical thing: I wrote his parents in New Delhiandaskediftheyhadanother onelikehimathome. Ofcourse,Iknewtheanswerbeforewriting.Thereisn’tanyonelike Ajit. Our smaller insurers are just as outstanding in their own way as the “big three,” regularly delivering valuable float to us at a negative cost. We aggregate their results below under “Other Primary.” For space reasons, we don’t discuss these insurers individually. But be assured that Charlie and I appreciate the contributionofeach.

Indeed, no purchaser of the mortgages it originated and then securitized has ever lost a dime of principalorinterest.But Claytonwastheexception;industrylosseswerestaggering.Andthehangovercontinues tothisday. This 1997-2000 fiasco should have served as a canary-in-the-coal-mine warning for the far-larger conventional housing market. But investors, government and rating agencies learned exactly nothing from the manufactured-home debacle. Instead, in an eerie rerun of that disaster, the same mistakes were repeated with conventionalhomesinthe2004-07period:Lendershappilymadeloansthatborrowerscouldn’trepayoutoftheir incomes, and borrowers just as happily signed uptomeet thosepayments. Bothparties countedon“house-price appreciation” to make this otherwise impossible arrangement work. It was Scarlett O’Hara all over again: “I’ll think about it tomorrow.” The consequences of this behavior are now reverberating through every corner of our economy. Clayton’s 198,888 borrowers, however, have continued to pay normally throughout the housing crash, handingusnounexpectedlosses.Thisisnotbecausetheseborrowersareunusuallycreditworthy,apointproved by FICO scores (a standard measure of credit risk). Their median FICO score is 644, compared to a national median of 723, and about 35% are below 620, the segment usually designated “sub-prime.” Many disastrous pools of mortgages on conventional homes are populated by borrowers with far better credit, as measured by FICOscores. Yet at yearend, our delinquency rate on loans we have originated was 3.6%, up only modestly from 2.9%in2006and2.9%in2004.(Inadditiontoouroriginatedloans,we’vealsoboughtbulkportfoliosofvarious types from other financial institutions.) Clayton’s foreclosures during 2008 were 3.0% of originated loans comparedto3.8%in2006and5.3%in2004.

Butourproblemswillnotbedriventoanyextentbythetrendofhomeprices. Commentary about the current housing crisis often ignores the crucial fact that most foreclosures do not occur because a house is worth less than its mortgage (so-called “upside-down” loans). Rather, foreclosures take place because borrowers can’t pay the monthly payment that they agreed to pay. Homeowners who have made a meaningful down-payment – derived from savings and not from other borrowing – seldom walk away fromaprimaryresidencesimplybecauseitsvaluetodayislessthanthemortgage.Instead,theywalkwhenthey can’tmakethemonthlypayments.

Thepresent housingdebacle shouldteach homebuyers,lenders, brokers andgovernmentsomesimple lessons that will ensure stability in the future.

Putting people into homes, though a desirable goal, shouldn’t be our country’s primary objective. Keepingthemintheirhomesshouldbetheambition.   Clayton’s lending operation, though not damaged by the performance of its borrowers, is nevertheless threatened by an element of the credit crisis. Funders that have access to any sort of government guarantee – bankswith FDIC-insureddeposits,largeentitieswithcommercialpapernowbackedbythe Federal Reserve,and others whoare using imaginative methods (or lobbying skills) to come under the government’s umbrella –have money costs that are minimal. Conversely, highly-rated companies, such as Berkshire, are experiencing borrowing costs that, in relation to Treasury rates, are at record levels. Moreover, funds are abundant for the government-guaranteedborrowerbutoftenscarceforothers,nomatterhowcreditworthytheymaybe.

Tax-Exempt Bond Insurance Early in 2008, we activated Berkshire Hathaway Assurance Company (“BHAC”) as an insurer of the tax-exempt bonds issued by states, cities and other local entities. BHACinsures these securities for issuers both atthetimetheirbondsaresoldtothepublic(primary transactions) andlater,whenthebondsarealreadyowned byinvestors(secondarytransactions). By yearend 2007, the half dozen or so companies that had been the major players in this business had allfallenintobigtrouble.Thecauseoftheirproblemswascapturedlongagoby Mae West:“Iwas Snow White, but Idrifted.” The monolines (as the bond insurers are called) initially insured only tax-exempt bonds that were low-risk. But over the years competition for this business intensified, and rates fell. Faced with the prospect of stagnating or declining earnings, the monoline managers turned to ever-riskier propositions. Some of these involved the insuring of residential mortgage obligations. When housing prices plummeted, the monoline industryquicklybecameabasketcase. Early in the year, Berkshire offered to assume all of the insurance issued on tax-exempts that was on the books of the three largest monolines. These companies were all in life-threatening trouble (though they said otherwise.) We would have charged a 11⁄ 2% rate to take over the guarantees on about $822 billion of bonds. If our offer had been accepted, we would have been required to pay any losses suffered by investors who owned these bonds – a guarantee stretching for 40 years in some cases. Ours was not a frivolous proposal: For reasons wewillcometolater,itinvolvedsubstantialriskfor Berkshire. The monolines summarily rejected our offer, in some cases appending an insult or two. In the end, though, the turndowns proved to be very good news for us, because it became apparent that I had severely underpricedouroffer. Thereafter, we wrote about $15.6 billion of insurance in the secondary market. And here’s the punch line: About 77% of this business was on bonds that were already insured, largely by the three aforementioned monolines.Intheseagreements,wehavetopayfordefaultsonlyiftheoriginalinsurerisfinanciallyunabletodo so. Wewrotethis“second-to-pay”insuranceforratesaveraging3.3%.That’sright;wehavebeenpaidfar more for becoming the second to pay than the 1.5% wewouldhaveearlier chargedtobethefirst topay.Inone extreme case, we actually agreed to be fourth to pay, nonetheless receiving about three times the 1% premium charged by the monoline that remains first to pay. In other words, three other monolines have to first go broke beforeweneedtowriteacheck. Two of the three monolines to which we made our initial bulk offer later raised substantial capital. This, of course, directly helps us, since it makes it less likely that we will have to pay, at least in the near term, any claims on our second-to-pay insurance because these two monolines fail. In addition to our book of secondary business, we have also written $3.7 billion of primary business for a premium of $96 million. In primarybusiness,ofcourse,wearefirsttopayiftheissuergetsintrouble. We have a great many more multiples of capital behind the insurance we write than does any other monoline. Consequently, our guarantee is far more valuable than theirs. This explains why many sophisticated investors have bought second-to-pay insurance from us even though they were already insured by another monoline.BHAChasbecomenotonlytheinsurerofpreference,butinmanycasesthesoleinsureracceptableto bondholders. Nevertheless, we remain very cautious about the business we write and regard it as far from a sure thingthatthisinsurancewillultimatelybeprofitableforus.Thereasonissimple,though Ihaveneverseeneven apassingreferencetoitbyanyfinancialanalyst,ratingagencyormonoline CEO. The rationale behind very low premium rates for insuring tax-exempts has been that defaults have historically been few. But that record largely reflects the experience of entities that issued uninsured bonds. Insuranceoftax-exemptbondsdidn’texistbefore1971,andevenafterthatmostbondsremaineduninsured. A universe of tax-exempts fully covered by insurance would be certain to have a somewhat different loss experience from a group of uninsured, but otherwise similar bonds, the only question being how different. To understand why, let’s go back to 1975 when New York City was on the edge of bankruptcy. At the time its bonds – virtually all uninsured – were heavily held by the city’s wealthier residents as well as by New York banksandotherinstitutions.Theselocalbondholdersdeeplydesiredtosolvethecity’sfiscalproblems.Sobefore long, concessions and cooperation from a host of involved constituencies produced a solution. Without one, it was apparent to all that New York’s citizens and businesses would have experienced widespread and severe financiallossesfromtheirbondholdings. Now, imagine that all of the city’s bonds had instead been insured by Berkshire. Would similar belt- tightening,taxincreases,laborconcessions,etc.havebeenforthcoming?Ofcoursenot.Ataminimum,Berkshire would have been asked to “share” in the required sacrifices. And, considering our deep pockets, the required contributionwouldmostcertainlyhavebeensubstantial. Local governments are going to face far tougher fiscal problems in the future than they have to date. The pension liabilities I talked about in last year’s report will be a huge contributor to these woes. Many cities andstatesweresurelyhorrifiedwhentheyinspectedthestatusoftheirfundingatyearend2008.Thegapbetween assetsandarealisticactuarialvaluationofpresentliabilitiesissimplystaggering. When faced with large revenue shortfalls, communities that have all of their bonds insured will be more prone to develop “solutions” less favorable to bondholders than those communities that have uninsured bonds held by local banks and residents. Losses in the tax-exempt arena, when they come, are also likely to be highly correlated among issuers. If a few communities stiff their creditors and get away with it, the chance that others will follow in their footsteps will grow. What mayor or city council is going to choose pain to local citizensintheformofmajortaxincreasesoverpaintoafar-awaybondinsurer? Insuring tax-exempts, therefore, has the look today of a dangerous business – one with similarities, in fact, to the insuring of natural catastrophes. In both cases, a string of loss-free years can be followed by a devastatingexperiencethatmorethanwipesoutallearlierprofits.Wewilltry,therefore,toproceedcarefullyin thisbusiness,eschewingmanyclassesofbondsthatothermonolinesregularlyembrace.   Thetypeoffallacyinvolvedinprojectinglossexperiencefromauniverseofnon-insuredbondsontoa deceptively-similar universe in which many bonds are insured pops up in other areas of finance. “Back-tested” models of many kinds are susceptible to this sort of error. Nevertheless, they are frequently touted in financial marketsasguidestofutureaction.(Ifmerelylookinguppastfinancialdatawouldtellyouwhatthefutureholds, the Forbes400wouldconsistoflibrarians.) Indeed, the stupefying losses in mortgage-related securities came in large part because of flawed, history-based models used by salesmen, rating agencies and investors. These parties looked at loss experience over periods when home prices rose only moderately and speculation in houses wasnegligible. Theythen made this experience a yardstick for evaluating future losses. They blissfully ignored the fact that house prices had recentlyskyrocketed,loanpracticeshaddeterioratedandmanybuyershadoptedforhousestheycouldn’tafford. In short, universe “past” and universe “current” had very different characteristics. But lenders, government and medialargelyfailedtorecognizethisall-importantfact. Investors should be skeptical of history-based models. Constructed by a nerdy-sounding priesthood using esoteric terms such as beta, gamma, sigma and the like, these models tend to look impressive. Too often, though, investors forget to examine the assumptions behind the symbols. Our advice: Beware of geeks bearing formulas.   A final post-script on BHAC: Who, you may wonder, runs this operation? While I help set policy, all of the heavy lifting is done by Ajit and his crew. Sure, they were already generating $24 billion of float along with hundreds of millions of underwriting profit annually. But how busy can that keep a 31-person group?

In addition, we have holdings in Moody’s and Burlington Northern Santa Fe that we now carry at “equity value” – our cost plus retained earnings since our purchase, minus the tax that would be paid if those earnings were paid to us as dividends. This accounting treatment is usually required when ownership of an investeecompanyreaches20%. We purchased 15% of Moody’s some years ago and have not since bought a share. Moody’s, though, has repurchased its own shares and, by late 2008, those repurchases reduced its outstanding shares to the point that our holdings rose above 20%. Burlington Northern has also repurchased shares, but our increase to 20% primarilyoccurredbecausewecontinuedtobuythisstock.

I told you in an earlier part of this report that last year I made a major mistake of commission (and maybe more; this one sticks out).

When forced to choose, I will not trade even a night’s sleep for the chance of extra profits. The investment world has gone from underpricing risk to overpricing it. This change has not been minor; the pendulum has covered an extraordinary arc. A few years ago, it wouldhave seemed unthinkable that yields like today’s could have been obtained on good-grade municipal or corporate bonds even while risk-free governmentsofferednear-zeroreturnsonshort-termbondsandnobetterthanapittanceonlong-terms.Whenthe financial history of this decade is written, it will surely speak of the Internet bubble of the late 1990s and the housing bubble of the early 2000s. But the U.S. Treasury bond bubble of late 2008 may be regarded as almost equallyextraordinary. Clinging to cash equivalents or long-term government bonds at present yields is almost certainly a terriblepolicyifcontinuedforlong.Holdersoftheseinstruments,ofcourse,havefeltincreasinglycomfortable– in fact, almost smug – in following this policy as financial turmoil has mounted. They regard their judgment confirmed when they hear commentators proclaim “cash is king,” even though that wonderful cash is earning closetonothingandwillsurelyfinditspurchasingpowererodedovertime. Approval, though, is not the goal of investing. In fact, approval is often counter-productive because it sedates the brain and makes it less receptive to new facts or a re-examination of conclusions formed earlier.

For a case study on regulatory effectiveness, let’s look harder at the Freddie and Fannie example. These giant institutions were created by Congress, which retained control over them, dictating what they could and could not do. To aid its oversight, Congress created OFHEO in 1992, admonishing it to make sure the two behemoths werebehavingthemselves. Withthat move,Fannieand Freddiebecamethemostintensely-regulated companiesofwhich Iamaware,asmeasuredbymanpowerassignedtothetask. On June 15,2003,OFHEO(whose annual reports are available onthe Internet) sent its 2002report to Congress–specificallytoitsfourbossesinthe Senateand House,amongthemnoneotherthan Messrs.Sarbanes and Oxley. The report’s 127 pages included a self-congratulatory cover-line: “Celebrating 10 Years of Excellence.” The transmittal letter and report were delivered nine days after the CEO and CFO of Freddie had resigned in disgrace and the COO had been fired. No mention of their departures was made in the letter, even whilethereportconcluded,asitalwaysdid,that“Both Enterpriseswerefinanciallysoundandwellmanaged.” In truth, both enterprises had engaged in massive accounting shenanigans for some time.

A normal stock or bond trade is completed in a few days with one party getting its cash, the other its securities. Counterparty risk therefore quickly disappears, which means credit problems can’t accumulate. This rapid settlement process is key to maintaining the integrity of markets. That, in fact, is a reason for NYSE and NASDAQshorteningthesettlementperiodfromfivedaystothreedaysin1995. Derivatives contracts, in contrast, often go unsettled for years, or even decades, with counterparties building up huge claims against each other. “Paper” assets and liabilities – often hard to quantify – become important parts of financial statements though these items will not be validated for many years. Additionally, a frightening webof mutual dependence develops among huge financial institutions.

Considering the ruin I’ve pictured, you may wonder why Berkshire is a party to 251 derivatives contracts (other than those used for operational purposes at Mid American and the few left over at Gen Re).The answer is simple: I believe each contract we own was mispriced at inception, sometimes dramatically so. I both initiatedthesepositionsandmonitorthem,asetofresponsibilitiesconsistentwithmybeliefthatthe CEOofany largefinancialorganizationmustbethe Chief Risk Officeraswell.Ifwelosemoneyonourderivatives,itwillbe myfault. Our derivatives dealings require our counterparties to make payments to us when contracts are initiated. Berkshire therefore always holds the money, which leaves us assuming no meaningful counterparty risk. As of yearend, the payments made to us less losses we have paid – our derivatives “float,” so to speak – totaled$8.1billion.Thisfloatissimilartoinsurancefloat:Ifwebreakevenonanunderlyingtransaction,wewill haveenjoyedtheuseoffreemoneyforalongtime.Ourexpectation,thoughitisfarfromasurething,isthatwe willdobetterthanbreakevenandthatthesubstantialinvestmentincomeweearnonthefundswillbefrostingon thecake.

In our quarterly reports, however, the amount of gain or loss has swung wildly from a profitof$327millioninthesecondquarterof2008toalossof$693millioninthefourthquarterof 2008. Surprisingly, we made payments on these contracts of only $97 million last year, far below the estimate I used when I decided to enter into them. This year, however, losses have accelerated sharplywiththemushroomingoflargebankruptcies.Inlastyear’sletter,Itoldyou Iexpectedthese contracts to show a profit at expiration. Now, with the recession deepening at a rapid rate, the possibilityofaneventuallosshasincreased.Whatevertheresult,Iwillkeepyouposted. • In 2008 we began to write “credit default swaps” on individual companies. This is simply credit insurance, similar to what we write in BHAC, except that here we bear the credit risk of corporationsratherthanoftax-exemptissuers. If, say, the XYZ company goes bankrupt, and we have written a $100 million contract, we are obligated to pay an amount that reflects the shrinkage in value of a comparable amount of XYZ’s debt. (If, for example, the company’s bonds are selling for 30 after default, we would owe $70 million.) For the typical contract, we receive quarterly payments for five years, after which our insuranceexpires. At yearend we had written $4 billion of contracts covering 42 corporations, for which we receive annual premiums of $93 million. This is the only derivatives business we write that has any counterpartyrisk;thepartythatbuysthecontractfromusmustbegoodforthequarterlypremiums it will owe us over the five years. We are unlikely to expand this business to any extent because most buyers of this protection now insist that the seller post collateral, and we will not enter into suchanarrangement. • At the request of our customers, we write a few tax-exempt bond insurance contracts that are similar to those written at BHAC, but that are structured as derivatives. The only meaningful difference between the two contracts is that mark-to-market accounting is required for derivatives whereasstandardaccrualaccountingisrequiredat BHAC. But this difference can produce some strange results. The bonds covered – in effect, insured – by thesederivativesarelargelygeneralobligationsofstates,andwefeelgoodaboutthem.Atyearend, however, mark-to-market accounting required us to record a loss of $631 million on these derivativescontracts.Hadweinsteadinsuredthesamebondsatthesamepricein BHAC,andused theaccrualaccountingrequiredatinsurancecompanies,wewouldhaverecordedasmallprofitfor the year. The two methods by which we insure the bonds will eventually produce the same accountingresult.Intheshortterm,however,thevarianceinreportedprofitscanbesubstantial. We have told you before that our derivative contracts, subject as they are to mark-to-market accounting, will produce wild swings in the earnings we report. The ups and downs neither cheer nor bother Charlie and me. Indeed, the “downs” can be helpful in that they give us an opportunity to expand a position on favorableterms.Ihopethisexplanationofourdealingswillleadyoutothinksimilarly.   The Black-Scholes formula has approached the status of holy writ in finance, and we use it when valuingourequityputoptionsforfinancialstatementpurposes.Keyinputstothecalculationincludeacontract’s maturityandstrikeprice,aswellastheanalyst’sexpectationsforvolatility,interestratesanddividends. If the formula is applied to extended time periods, however, it can produce absurd results. In fairness, Black and Scholes almost certainly understood this point well. But their devoted followers may be ignoring whatevercaveatsthetwomenattachedwhentheyfirstunveiledtheformula. It’softenusefulintestingatheorytopushittoextremes.Solet’spostulatethatwesella100-year$1 billion put option on the S&P 500 at a strike price of 903 (the index’s level on 12/31/08). Using the implied volatility assumption for long-dated contracts that we do, and combining that with appropriate interest and dividendassumptions,wewouldfindthe“proper”Black-Scholespremiumforthiscontracttobe$2.5million. To judge the rationality of that premium, we need to assess whether the S&Pwill be valued a century from nowat lessthantoday.Certainly thedollar willthenbeworthasmall fraction ofitspresent value(atonly 2% inflation it will be worth roughly 14¢). So that will be a factor pushing the stated value of the index higher. Far more important, however, is that one hundred years of retained earnings will hugely increase the value of most of the companies in the index. In the 20th Century, the Dow-Jones Industrial Average increased by about 175-fold,mainlybecauseofthisretained-earningsfactor. Considering everything, I believe the probability of a decline in the index over a one-hundred-year periodtobefarless than1%.Butlet’s usethat figureandalsoassumethatthemostlikelydecline–shouldone occur – is 50%. Under these assumptions, the mathematical expectation of loss on our contract would be $5 million($1billion X1%X50%). But if we had received our theoretical premium of $2.5 million up front, we would have only had to invest it at 0.7% compounded annually to cover this loss expectancy. Everything earned above that would have beenprofit.Wouldyouliketoborrowmoneyfor100yearsata0.7%rate? Let’slookatmyexamplefromaworst-casestandpoint.Rememberthat99%ofthetimewewouldpay nothingifmyassumptionsarecorrect.Butevenintheworstcaseamongtheremaining1%ofpossibilities–that is, one assuming a total loss of $1 billion – our borrowing cost would come to only 6.2%. Clearly, either my assumptionsarecrazyortheformulaisinappropriate. Theridiculous premium that Black-Scholesdictates inmyextremeexampleiscausedbytheinclusion of volatility in the formula andbythefact thatvolatility isdetermined byhowmuchstockshavemovedaround in some past period of days, months or years. This metric is simply irrelevant in estimating the probability- weightedrangeofvaluesof Americanbusiness100yearsfromnow.(Imagine,ifyouwill,gettingaquoteevery day on a farm from a manic-depressive neighbor and then using the volatility calculated from these changing quotesasanimportantingredientinanequationthatpredictsaprobability-weightedrangeofvaluesforthefarm acenturyfromnow.) Thoughhistoricalvolatilityisauseful–butfarfromfoolproof–conceptinvaluingshort-termoptions, itsutilitydiminishesrapidlyasthedurationoftheoptionlengthens.Inmyopinion,thevaluationsthatthe Black- Scholes formula now place on our long-term put options overstate our liability, though the overstatement will diminishasthecontractsapproachmaturity. Even so, we will continue to use Black-Scholes when we are estimating our financial-statement liability for long-term equity puts. The formula represents conventional wisdom and any substitute that I might offer would engender extreme skepticism. That would be perfectly understandable: CEOs who have concocted their own valuations for esoteric financial instruments have seldom erred onthe side of conservatism.
