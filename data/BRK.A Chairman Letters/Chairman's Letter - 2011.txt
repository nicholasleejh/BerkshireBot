This business produces “float” – money that doesn’t belong to us, but that we get to invest for Berkshire’s benefit. And if we pay out less in losses and expenses than we receive in premiums, we additionally earn an underwriting profit, meaning the float costs us less than nothing. Though we are sure to have underwriting losses from time to time, we’ve now had nine consecutive years of underwriting profits, totaling about $17 billion.

Swiss Re, Goldman Sachs and General Electric paid us an aggregate of $12.8 billion to redeem securities that were producing about $1.2 billion of pre-tax earnings for Berkshire. That’s a lot of incometoreplace,thoughour Lubrizolpurchasedidoffsetmostofit. • Last year, I told you that “a housing recovery will probably begin within a year or so.” I was dead wrong. We have five businesses whose results are significantly influenced by housing activity. The connection is direct at Clayton Homes, which is the largest producer of homes in the country, accountingforabout7%ofthoseconstructedduring2011. Additionally, Acme Brick, Shaw (carpet), Johns Manville (insulation) and Mi Tek (building products, primarily connector plates used in roofing) are all materially affected by construction activity. In aggregate, our five housing-related companies had pre-tax profits of $513 million in 2011. That’s similarto2010butdownfrom$1.8billionin2006. Housingwillcomeback–youcanbesureofthat.Overtime,thenumberofhousingunitsnecessarily matches the number of households (after allowing for a normal level of vacancies). For a period of years prior to 2008, however, America added more housing units than households. Inevitably, we endedupwithfartoomanyunitsandthebubblepoppedwithaviolencethatshooktheentireeconomy. Thatcreatedstillanotherproblemforhousing:Earlyinarecession,householdformationsslow,andin 2009thedecreasewasdramatic. Thatdevastatingsupply/demandequationisnowreversed:Everydaywearecreatingmorehouseholds than housing units. People may postpone hitching up during uncertain times, but eventually hormones takeover.Andwhile“doubling-up”maybetheinitialreactionofsomeduringarecession,livingwith in-lawscanquicklyloseitsallure. At our current annual pace of 600,000 housing starts – considerably less than the number of new households being formed – buyers and renters are sopping up what’s left of the old oversupply. (This process will run its course at different rates around the country; the supply-demand situation varies widely by locale.) While this healing takes place, however, our housing-related companies sputter, employing only 43,315 people compared to 58,769 in 2006. This hugely important sector of the economy, which includes not only construction but everything that feeds off of it, remains in a depression of its own. I believe this is the major reason a recovery in employment has so severely laggedthesteadyandsubstantialcomebackwehaveseeninalmostallothersectorsofoureconomy. Wisemonetaryandfiscalpoliciesplayanimportantroleintemperingrecessions,butthesetoolsdon’t create households nor eliminate excess housing units. Fortunately, demographics and our market system will restore the needed balance – probably before long. When that day comes, we will again build one million or more residential units annually. I believe pundits will be surprised at how far unemployment drops once that happens. They will then reawake to what has been true since 1776: America’sbestdayslieahead. Intrinsic Business Value Charlie and I measure our performance by the rate of gain in Berkshire’s per-share intrinsic business value. If our gain over time outstrips the performance of the S&P 500, we have earned our paychecks. If it doesn’t,weareoverpaidatanyprice. Wehavenowaytopinpointintrinsicvalue.Butwedohaveauseful,thoughconsiderablyunderstated, proxy for it: per-share book value. This yardstick is meaningless at most companies. At Berkshire, however, bookvalue very roughly tracks business values.That’s becausetheamount bywhich Berkshire’s intrinsic value exceeds book value does not swing wildly from year to year, though it increases in most years. Over time, the divergencewilllikelybecomeevermoresubstantialinabsoluteterms,remainingreasonablysteady,however,on apercentagebasisasboththenumeratoranddenominatorofthebusiness-value/book-valueequationincrease. We’veregularlyemphasizedthatourbook-valueperformanceisalmostcertaintooutpacethe S&P500 in a bad year for the stock market and just as certainly will fall short in a strong up-year.

It will almost certainly snap, though, if the S&P 500 should put together a five-year winningstreak(whichitmaywellbeonitswaytodoingas Iwritethis).   I also included two tables last year that set forth the key quantitative ingredients that will help you estimate our per-share intrinsic value.

We have witnessed many bouts of repurchasing that failed our second test. Sometimes, of course, infractions – even serious ones – are innocent; many CEOs never stop believing their stock is cheap. In other instances,alessbenignconclusionseemswarranted.Itdoesn’tsufficetosaythatrepurchasesarebeingmadeto offset the dilution from stock issuances or simply because a company has excess cash. Continuing shareholders are hurt unless shares are purchased below intrinsic value. The first law of capital allocation – whether the moneyisslatedforacquisitionsorsharerepurchases–isthatwhatissmartatonepriceisdumbatanother.(One CEO who always stresses the price/value factor in repurchase decisions is Jamie Dimon at J.P. Morgan; I recommendthatyoureadhisannualletter.) Charlie and I have mixed emotions when Berkshire shares sell well below intrinsic value. We like making money for continuing shareholders, and there is no surer way to do that than by buying an asset – our own stock – that we know to be worth at least x for less than that – for.9x,.8x or even lower. (As one of our directorssays,it’slikeshootingfishinabarrel,afterthebarrelhasbeendrainedandthefishhavequitflopping.) Nevertheless, we don’t enjoy cashing out partners at a discount, even though our doing so may give the selling shareholders a slightly higher price than they would receive if our bid was absent. When we are buying, therefore,wewantthoseexitingpartnerstobefullyinformedaboutthevalueoftheassetstheyareselling. At our limit price of 110% of book value, repurchases clearly increase Berkshire’s per-share intrinsic value.Andthemoreandthecheaperwebuy,thegreaterthegainforcontinuingshareholders.Therefore,ifgiven the opportunity, we will likely repurchase stock aggressively at our price limit or lower. You should know, however,thatwehavenointerestinsupportingthestockandthatourbidswillfadeinparticularlyweakmarkets. Nor will we buy shares if our cash-equivalent holdings are below $20 billion. At Berkshire, financial strength thatisunquestionabletakesprecedenceoverallelse.

Let’suse IBMasanexample.Asallbusinessobserversknow,CEOs Lou Gerstnerand Sam Palmisano did a superb job in moving IBM from near-bankruptcy twenty years ago to its prominence today. Their operationalaccomplishmentsweretrulyextraordinary. But their financial management was equally brilliant, particularly in recent years as the company’s financialflexibilityimproved.Indeed,Icanthinkofnomajorcompanythathashadbetterfinancialmanagement,a skillthathasmateriallyincreasedthegainsenjoyedby IBMshareholders.Thecompanyhasuseddebtwisely,made value-addingacquisitionsalmostexclusivelyforcashandaggressivelyrepurchaseditsownstock. Today, IBM has 1.16 billion shares outstanding, of which we own about 63.9 million or 5.5%. Naturally, what happens to the company’s earnings over the next five years is of enormous importance to us. Beyondthat,thecompanywilllikelyspend$50billionorsointhoseyearstorepurchaseshares.Ourquizforthe day:Whatshouldalong-termshareholder,suchas Berkshire,cheerforduringthatperiod? Iwon’tkeepyouinsuspense.Weshouldwishfor IBM’sstockpricetolanguishthroughoutthefiveyears. Let’sdothemath.If IBM’sstockpriceaverages,say,$200duringtheperiod,thecompanywillacquire 250 million shares for its $50 billion. There would consequently be 910 million shares outstanding, and we would own about 7% of the company. If the stock conversely sells for an average of $300 during the five-year period, IBM will acquire only 167 million shares. That would leave about 990 million shares outstanding after fiveyears,ofwhichwewouldown6.5%. If IBMweretoearn,say,$20billioninthefifthyear,ourshareofthoseearningswouldbeafull$100 milliongreaterunderthe“disappointing”scenarioofalowerstockpricethantheywouldhavebeenatthehigher price. At some later point our shares would be worth perhaps $11⁄ 2 billion more than if the “high-price” repurchasescenariohadtakenplace. Thelogicissimple:Ifyouaregoingtobeanetbuyerofstocksinthefuture,eitherdirectlywithyourown money or indirectly (through your ownership of a company that is repurchasing shares), you are hurt when stocks rise. You benefit when stocks swoon. Emotions, however, too often complicate the matter: Most people, including thosewhowillbenetbuyersinthefuture,takecomfortinseeingstockpricesadvance.Theseshareholdersresemble acommuterwhorejoicesafterthepriceofgasincreases,simplybecausehistankcontainsaday’ssupply. Charlie and I don’t expect to win many of you over to our way of thinking – we’ve observed enough humanbehaviortoknowthefutilityofthat–butwedowantyoutobeawareofourpersonalcalculus.Andhere aconfessionisinorder:Inmyearlydays I,too,rejoicedwhenthemarketrose.Then Iread Chapter Eightof Ben Graham’s The Intelligent Investor, the chapter dealing with how investors should view fluctuations in stock prices.Immediatelythescalesfellfrommyeyes,andlowpricesbecamemyfriend.Pickingupthatbookwasone oftheluckiestmomentsinmylife.

Now, let’s examine the four major sectors of our operations. Each has vastly different balance sheet and income characteristics from the others. Lumping them together therefore impedes analysis. Sowe’llpresent them as four separate businesses, which is how Charlie and I view them. Because we may be repurchasing Berkshiresharesfromsomeofyou,wewillofferourthoughtsineachsectionastohowintrinsicvaluecompares tocarryingvalue. Insurance Let’slookfirstatinsurance,Berkshire’scoreoperationandtheenginethathaspropelledourexpansion overtheyears. Property-casualty (“P/C”) insurers receive premiums upfront and pay claims later. In extreme cases, such as those arising from certain workers’ compensation accidents, payments can stretch over decades. This collect-now, pay-later model leaves us holding large sums – money we call “float” – that will eventually go to others. Meanwhile, we get to invest this float for Berkshire’s benefit. Though individual policies and claims come and go, the amount of float we hold remains remarkably stable in relation to premium volume. Consequently,asourbusinessgrows,sodoesourfloat.Andhowwehavegrown,asthefollowingtableshows: Year Float(in$millions) 1970 $ 39 1980 237 1990 1,632 2000 27,871 2010 65,832 2011 70,571 It’sunlikelythatourfloatwillgrowmuch–ifatall–fromitscurrentlevel.That’smainlybecausewe alreadyhaveanoutsizedamountrelative toourpremiumvolume.Weretheretobeadeclineinfloat,Iwilladd, itwouldalmostcertainlybeverygradualandthereforeimposenounusualdemandforfundsonus. If our premiums exceed the total of our expenses and eventual losses, we register an underwriting profit that adds to the investment income our float produces. When such a profit occurs, we enjoy the use of free money – and, better yet, get paid for holding it. Unfortunately, the wish of all insurers to achieve this happy result creates intense competition, so vigorous in most years that it causes the P/C industry as a whole to operateatasignificantunderwritingloss.Forexample,State Farm,byfarthecountry’slargestinsurerandawell-managed company besides, has incurred an underwriting loss in eight of the last eleven years. There are alotofwaystolosemoneyininsurance,andtheindustryisresourcefulincreatingnewones. As noted in the first section of this report, we have now operated at an underwriting profit for nine consecutive years, our gain for the period having totaled $17 billion. I believe it likely that we will continue to underwrite profitably in most – though certainly not all – future years. If we accomplish that, our float will be betterthancost-free.Wewillprofitjustaswewouldifsomepartydeposited$70.6billionwithus,paidusafee forholdingitsmoneyandthenletusinvestitsfundsforourownbenefit. So how does this attractive float affect intrinsic value calculations? Our float is deducted in full as a liability in calculating Berkshire’s book value, just as if we had to pay it out tomorrow and were unable to replenish it. But that’s an incorrect way to view float, which should instead be viewed as a revolving fund. If floatisbothcostlessandlong-enduring,thetruevalueofthisliabilityisfarlowerthantheaccountingliability. Partially offsetting this overstated liability is $15.5 billion of “goodwill” attributable to our insurance companiesthatisincludedinbookvalueasanasset.Ineffect,thisgoodwillrepresents thepricewepaidforthe float-generatingcapabilitiesofourinsuranceoperations.Thecostofthegoodwill,however,hasnobearingonits true value. If an insurance business produces large and sustained underwriting losses, any goodwill asset attributabletoitshouldbedeemedvalueless,whateveritsoriginalcost. Fortunately, that’s not the case at Berkshire. Charlie and I believe the true economic value of our insurance goodwill – what we would pay to purchase float of similar quality – to be far in excess of its historic carrying value. The value of our float is one reason – a huge reason – why we believe Berkshire’s intrinsic businessvaluesubstantiallyexceedsbookvalue. Letmeemphasizeonceagainthatcost-freefloatisnotanoutcometobeexpectedforthe P/Cindustry asawhole:Wedon’tthinkthereismuch“Berkshire-quality”floatexistingintheinsuranceworld.Inmostyears, including2011,theindustry’s premiums havebeeninadequatetocoverclaimsplusexpenses.Consequently,the industry’soverallreturnontangibleequityhasformanydecadesfallenfarshortoftheaveragereturnrealizedby Americanindustry,asorryperformancealmostcertaintocontinue.Berkshire’soutstandingeconomicsexistonly becausewehavesometerrificmanagersrunningsomeextraordinaryinsuranceoperations.Letmetellyouabout themajorunits.

For example, if the insurance industry should experience a $250 billion loss from some mega-catastrophe – a loss about triple anything it has ever faced – Berkshire as a whole would likely record a moderate profit for the year because of its many streams of earnings. Concurrently, all other major insurers and reinsurerswouldbefarinthered,andsomewouldfaceinsolvency. From a standing start in 1985, Ajit has created an insurance business with float of $34 billion and significant underwriting profits, a feat that no CEO of any other insurer has come close to matching. By these accomplishments, he has added a great many billions of dollars to the value of Berkshire. Charlie would gladly trademeforasecond Ajit.Alas,thereisnone.   Wehaveanotherinsurancepowerhousein General Re,managedby Tad Montross. At bottom, a sound insurance operation needs to adhere to four disciplines. It must (1) understand all exposures that might cause a policy to incur losses; (2) conservatively evaluate the likelihood of any exposure actually causing a loss and the probable cost if it does; (3) set a premium that will deliver a profit, on average, after both prospective loss costs and operating expenses are covered; and (4) be willing to walk away if the appropriatepremiumcan’tbeobtained. Manyinsurerspassthefirstthreetestsandflunkthefourth.Theysimplycan’tturntheirbackonbusiness that their competitors are eagerly writing. That old line, “The other guy is doing it so we must as well,” spells trouble in any business, but in none more so than insurance.

Regulated,Capital-Intensive Businesses We have two very large businesses, BNSF and Mid American Energy, that have important common characteristicsdistinguishingthemfromourmanyotherbusinesses.Consequently,weassignthemtheirownsector inthisletterandalsosplitouttheircombinedfinancialstatisticsinour GAAPbalancesheetandincomestatement. A key characteristic of both companies is the huge investment they have in very long-lived, regulated assets, with these partially funded by large amounts of long-term debt that is not guaranteed by Berkshire. Our credit is not needed: Both businesses have earning power that even under terrible business conditions amply covers their interest requirements. In a less than robust economy during 2011, for example, BNSF’s interest coverage was 9.5x. At Mid American, meanwhile, two key factors ensure its ability to service debt under all circumstances: The stability of earnings that is inherent in our exclusively offering an essential service and a diversityofearningsstreams,whichshielditfromtheactionsofanysingleregulatorybody. Measured by ton-miles, rail moves 42% of America’s inter-city freight, and BNSF moves more than any other railroad – about 37% of the industry total. A little math will tell you that about 15% of all inter-city ton-miles of freight in the U.S. is transported by BNSF. It is no exaggeration to characterize railroads as the circulatorysystemofoureconomy.Yourrailroadisthelargestartery.

Tofulfillitssocietalobligation,BNSFregularlyinvestsfarmorethanitsdepreciationcharge,withthe excess amounting to $1.8 billion in 2011. The three other major U.S. railroads are making similar outlays. Though many people decry our country’s inadequate infrastructure spending, that criticism cannot be levied against the railroad industry. It is pouring money – funds from the private sector – into the investment projects needed to provide better and more extensive service in the future. If railroads were not making these huge expenditures, our country’s publicly-financed highway system would face even greater congestion and maintenanceproblemsthanexisttoday. Massive investments of thesortthat BNSFismakingwouldbefoolish ifitcouldnotearnappropriate returns on the incremental sums it commits. But I am confident it will do so because of the value it delivers. Many years ago Ben Franklin counseled, “Keep thy shop, and thy shop will keep thee.” Translating this to our regulated businesses, he might today say, “Take care of your customer, and the regulator – your customer’s representative–willtakecareofyou.”Goodbehaviorbyeachpartybegetsgoodbehaviorinreturn. At Mid American,weparticipateinasimilar“socialcompact.”Weareexpectedtoputupever-increasing sums to satisfy the future needs of our customers. If we meanwhile operate reliably and efficiently, weknowthatwewillobtainafairreturnontheseinvestments. Mid American, 89.8% owned by Berkshire, supplies 2.5 million customers in the U.S. with electricity, operating as the largest supplier in Iowa, Utah and Wyoming and as an important provider in six other states as well.Ourpipelinestransport8%ofthecountry’snaturalgas.Obviously,manymillionsof Americansdependon useveryday.Theyhaven’tbeendisappointed.

In the most recent report, Northern Naturalwasrankedsecond.Thetopspotwasheldbyourotherpipeline,Kern River. In its electric business, Mid American has a comparable record.

Mid Americanwillhave3,316megawattsofwindgenerationinoperationbytheendof2012,farmore than any other regulated electric utility in the country.

The steady and substantial comeback in the U.S. economy since mid-2009 is clear from the earnings shownat the front of this section. This compilation includes 54of our companies. Butone of these, Marmon, is itself the owner of 140 operations in eleven distinct business sectors. In short, when you look at Berkshire, you arelookingacrosscorporate America.Solet’sdigalittledeepertogainagreaterinsightintowhathashappened inthelastfewyears. The four housing-related companies in this section (a group that excludes Clayton, which is carried under Finance and Financial Products) had aggregate pre-tax earnings of $227 million in 2009, $362 million in 2010and$359millionin2011.Ifyousubtracttheseearningsfromthoseinthecombinedstatement,youwillsee thatourmultiple anddiverse non-housingoperationsearned$1,831millionin2009,$3,912millionin2010and $4,678millionin2011.About$291millionofthe2011earningscamefromthe Lubrizolacquisition.Theprofile of the remaining 2011 earnings – $4,387 million – illustrates the comeback of much of America from the devastation wrought by the 2008 financial panic. Though housing-related businesses remain in the emergency room,mostotherbusinesseshaveleftthehospitalwiththeirhealthfullyrestored.

Our experience with NFM and the Blumkin family that runs it has been a real joy. The business was built by Rose Blumkin (known to all as “Mrs. B”), who started the company in 1937 with $500 and a dream. She sold me our interest when she was 89 and worked until she was 103. (After retiring, she diedthenextyear,asequence Ipointouttoanyother Berkshiremanagerwhoeventhinksofretiring.)

Never inclined to let an extraordinary gene pool go to waste, I am rejoicingthesedaysbecauseseveralmembersofthefourth Blumkingenerationhavejoined NFM. Overall, the intrinsic value of the businesses in this Berkshire sector significantly exceeds their book value.Formanyofthesmallercompanies,however,thisisnottrue.Ihavemademorethanmyshareofmistakes buying small companies. Charlie long ago told me, “If something’s not worth doing at all, it’s not worth doing well,” and I should have listened harder. In any event, our large purchases have generally worked well–extraordinarilywellinafewcases–andoverallthissectorisawinnerforus.   Certain shareholders have told me they hunger for more discussions of accounting arcana. Sohere’s a bitof GAAP-mandatednonsense Ihopebothofthemenjoy. Common sense wouldtell youthat ourvaried subsidiaries shouldbecarried onourbooksattheir cost plustheearningstheyhaveretainedsinceourpurchase(unlesstheireconomicvaluehasmateriallydecreased,in whichcaseanappropriatewrite-downmustbetaken).Andthat’sessentiallytherealityat Berkshire–exceptfor theweirdsituationat Marmon.

Sofar,sogood.Then,inearly 2011,pursuant toouroriginalcontractwiththe Pritzkerfamily,wepurchasedan additional 16%, paying $1.5 billion as called for by a formula that reflected Marmon’s increased value. In this instance, however, we were required to immediately write off $614 million of the purchase price retroactive to the end of 2010. (Don’t ask!) Obviously, this write-off had no connection to economic reality. The excess of Marmon’sintrinsicvalueoveritscarryingvalueiswidenedbythismeaninglesswrite-down. Financeand Financial Products This sector, our smallest, includes two rental companies, XTRA (trailers) and CORT (furniture), and Clayton Homes,thecountry’sleadingproducerandfinancerofmanufacturedhomes.Asidefromthese100%-owned subsidiaries, we also include in this category a collection of financial assets and our 50% interest in Berkadia Commercial Mortgage. It’s instructive tolookatwhattranspired atourthree operating businesses after theeconomyfell offa cliffinlate2008,becausetheirexperiencesilluminatethefracturedrecoverythatlatercamealong. Results at our two leasing companies mirrored the “non-housing” economy. Their combined pre-tax earningswere$13millionin2009,$53millionin2010and$155millionin2011,animprovementreflectingthe steady recovery we have seen in almost all of our non-housing businesses. In contrast, Clayton’s world of manufactured housing(just likesite-built housing) hasenduredaveritable depression, experiencing norecovery to date. Manufactured housing sales in the nation were 49,789 homes in 2009, 50,046 in 2010 and 51,606 in 2011.(Whenhousingwasboomingin2005,theywere146,744.) Despitethesedifficult times,Claytonhascontinuedtooperateprofitably,largelybecauseitsmortgage portfolio has performed well under trying circumstances. Because we are the largest lender in the manufactured homes sector and are also normally lending to lower-and-middle-income families, youmight expectustosuffer heavy losses during a housing meltdown. But by sticking to old-fashioned loan policies – meaningful down payments and monthly payments with a sensible relationship to regular income – Clayton has kept losses to acceptablelevels.Ithasdonesoeventhoughmanyofourborrowershavehadnegativeequityforsometime. As is well-known, the U.S. went off the rails in its home-ownership and mortgage-lending policies, and for these mistakes our economy is now paying a huge price. All of us participated in the destructive behavior – government, lenders, borrowers, the media, rating agencies, you name it. At the core of the folly was the almost universal belief that the value of houses was certain to increase over time and that any dips would be inconsequential. The acceptance of this premise justified almost any price and practice in housing transactions. Homeowners everywhere felt richer and rushed to “monetize” the increased value of their homes by refinancings. These massive cash infusions fueled a consumption binge throughout our economy. It all seemed great fun while it lasted. (A largely unnoted fact: Large numbers of people who have “lost” their house through foreclosure have actually realized a profit because they carried out refinancings earlier that gave them cash in excessoftheircost.Inthesecases,theevictedhomeownerwasthewinner,andthevictimwasthelender.) In2007,thebubbleburst,justasallbubblesmust.Wearenowinthefourthyearofacurethat,though longandpainful,issuretosucceed.Today,householdformationsareconsistentlyexceedinghousingstarts. Clayton’s earnings should improve materially when the nation’s excess housing inventory is worked off. As I see things today, however, I believe the intrinsic value of the three businesses in this sector does not differmateriallyfromtheirbookvalue.

And as we will see, a non-fluctuating assetcanbeladenwithrisk. Investment possibilities are both many and varied. There are three major categories, however, and it’s importanttounderstandthecharacteristicsofeach.Solet’ssurveythefield. • Investments that are denominated in a given currency include money-market funds, bonds, mortgages, bankdeposits,andotherinstruments.Mostofthesecurrency-basedinvestmentsarethoughtofas“safe.” Intruththeyareamongthemostdangerousofassets.Theirbetamaybezero,buttheirriskishuge.

Eveninthe U.S.,wherethewishforastablecurrencyisstrong,thedollarhasfallenastaggering86% in value since 1965, when I took over management of Berkshire. It takes no less than $7today to buy what$1didatthattime.Consequently,atax-freeinstitutionwouldhaveneeded4.3%interestannually from bond investments over that period to simply maintain its purchasing power. Its managers would havebeenkiddingthemselvesiftheythoughtofanyportionofthatinterestas“income.” For tax-paying investors like you and me, the picture has been far worse. During the same 47-year period,continuousrollingof U.S.Treasurybillsproduced5.7%annually.Thatsoundssatisfactory.But if an individual investor paid personal income taxes at a rate averaging 25%, this 5.7% return would haveyieldednothinginthewayofrealincome.Thisinvestor’svisibleincometaxwouldhavestripped himof1.4pointsofthestatedyield,andtheinvisibleinflationtaxwouldhavedevouredtheremaining 4.3points.It’snoteworthythattheimplicitinflation“tax”wasmorethantripletheexplicitincometax thatourinvestorprobablythoughtofashismainburden.“In God We Trust”maybeimprintedonour currency,butthehandthatactivatesourgovernment’sprintingpresshasbeenalltoohuman. Highinterestrates,ofcourse,cancompensatepurchasersfortheinflationrisktheyfacewithcurrency-based investments–andindeed,ratesintheearly1980sdidthatjobnicely.Currentrates,however,donotcome close to offsetting the purchasing-power risk that investors assume. Right now bonds should come with a warninglabel. Undertoday’sconditions,therefore,Idonotlikecurrency-basedinvestments.Evenso,Berkshireholds significant amounts of them, primarily of the short-term variety. At Berkshire the need for ample liquidity occupies center stage and will never be slighted, however inadequate rates may be. Accommodating this need, we primarily hold U.S. Treasury bills, the only investment that can be countedonforliquidityunderthemostchaoticofeconomicconditions.Ourworkinglevelforliquidity is$20billion;$10billionisourabsoluteminimum. Beyondtherequirements thatliquidityandregulators imposeonus,wewillpurchasecurrency-related securities only if they offer the possibility of unusual gain – either because a particular credit is mispriced, as can occur in periodic junk-bond debacles, or because rates rise to a level that offers the possibility of realizing substantial capital gains on high-grade bonds when rates fall. Though we’ve exploitedbothopportunitiesinthepast–andmaydosoagain–wearenow180degreesremovedfrom such prospects. Today, a wry comment that Wall Streeter Shelby Cullom Davis made long ago seems apt:“Bondspromotedasofferingrisk-freereturnsarenowpricedtodeliverreturn-freerisk.” • Thesecondmajorcategoryofinvestmentsinvolvesassetsthatwillneverproduceanything,butthatare purchased in the buyer’s hope that someone else – who also knows that the assets will be forever unproductive – will pay more for them in the future. Tulips, of all things, briefly became a favorite of suchbuyersinthe17thcentury. This type of investment requires an expanding pool of buyers, who, in turn, are enticed because they believe the buying pool will expand still further. Owners are not inspired by what the asset itself can produce – it will remain lifeless forever – but rather by the belief that others will desire it even more avidlyinthefuture. Themajorassetinthiscategoryisgold,currentlyahugefavoriteofinvestorswhofearalmostallother assets, especially paper money (of whosevalue, as noted, they are right to be fearful). Gold,however, has two significant shortcomings, being neither of much use nor procreative. True, gold has some industrial and decorative utility, but the demand for these purposes is both limited and incapable of soaking up new production. Meanwhile, if you own one ounce of gold for an eternity, you will still ownoneounceatitsend. What motivates most gold purchasers is their belief that the ranks of the fearful will grow.During the past decade that belief has proved correct. Beyond that, the rising price has on its own generated additionalbuyingenthusiasm,attractingpurchaserswhoseetheriseasvalidatinganinvestmentthesis. As“bandwagon”investorsjoinanyparty,theycreatetheirowntruth–forawhile. Over the past 15 years, both Internet stocks and houses have demonstrated the extraordinary excesses thatcanbecreatedbycombininganinitiallysensiblethesiswithwell-publicizedrisingprices.Inthese bubbles, an army of originally skeptical investors succumbed to the “proof” delivered by the market, andthepoolofbuyers–foratime–expandedsufficientlytokeepthebandwagonrolling.Butbubbles blownlargeenoughinevitablypop.Andthentheoldproverbisconfirmedonceagain:“Whatthewise mandoesinthebeginning,thefooldoesintheend.” Today the world’s gold stock is about 170,000 metric tons. If all of this gold were melded together, it wouldformacubeofabout68feetperside.(Pictureitfittingcomfortablywithinabaseballinfield.)At $1,750perounce–gold’spriceas Iwritethis–itsvaluewouldbe$9.6trillion.Callthiscubepile A. Let’s now create a pile B costing an equal amount. For that, we could buy all U.S. cropland (400 million acres with output of about $200 billion annually), plus 16 Exxon Mobils (the world’s most profitable company, one earning more than $40 billion annually). After these purchases, we would have about $1 trillion left over for walking-around money (no sense feeling strapped after this buying binge).Canyouimagineaninvestorwith$9.6trillionselectingpile Aoverpile B? Beyond the staggering valuation given the existing stock of gold, current prices make today’s annual production of gold command about $160 billion. Buyers – whether jewelry and industrial users, frightened individuals, or speculators – must continually absorb this additional supply to merely maintainanequilibriumatpresentprices. Acenturyfromnowthe400millionacresoffarmlandwillhaveproducedstaggeringamountsofcorn, wheat, cotton, and other crops – and will continue to produce that valuable bounty, whatever the currency may be. Exxon Mobil will probably have delivered trillions of dollars in dividends to its owners and will also hold assets worth many more trillions (and, remember, you get 16 Exxons). The 170,000 tons of gold will be unchanged in size and still incapable of producing anything. You can fondlethecube,butitwillnotrespond. Admittedly, when people a century from now are fearful, it’s likely many will still rush to gold. I’m confident,however,thatthe$9.6trillioncurrentvaluationofpile Awillcompoundoverthecenturyat aratefarinferiortothatachievedbypile B. • Our first two categories enjoy maximum popularity at peaks of fear: Terror over economic collapse drives individuals to currency-based assets, most particularly U.S. obligations, and fear of currency collapse fosters movement to sterile assets such as gold. We heard “cash is king” in late 2008, just whencashshouldhavebeendeployedratherthanheld.Similarly,weheard“cashistrash”intheearly 1980s just when fixed-dollar investments were at their most attractive level in memory. On those occasions,investorswhorequiredasupportivecrowdpaiddearlyforthatcomfort. My ownpreference –and you knewthiswascoming–isourthird category: investment inproductive assets, whether businesses, farms, or real estate. Ideally, these assets should have the ability in inflationary times to deliver output that will retain its purchasing-power value while requiring a minimum ofnewcapital investment. Farms,realestate,andmanybusinessessuchas Coca-Cola,IBM and our own See’s Candy meet that double-barreled test. Certain other companies – think of our regulatedutilities,forexample–failitbecauseinflationplacesheavycapitalrequirementsonthem.To earn more, their owners must invest more. Even so, these investments will remain superior to nonproductiveorcurrency-basedassets.

Metaphorically,thesecommercial“cows”willliveforcenturiesandgiveevergreaterquantitiesof“milk” to boot. Their value will be determined not by the medium of exchange but rather by their capacity to deliver milk. Proceeds from the sale of the milk will compound for the ownersofthecows,justasthey did during the 20th century when the Dow increased from 66 to 11,497 (and paid loads of dividends as well).Berkshire’sgoalwillbetoincreaseitsownershipoffirst-classbusinesses.Ourfirstchoicewillbe to own them in their entirety – but we will also be owners by way of holding sizable amounts of marketablestocks.Ibelievethatoveranyextendedperiodoftimethiscategoryofinvestingwillproveto betherunawaywinneramongthethreewe’veexamined.Moreimportant,itwillbebyfarthesafest.

At Nebraska Furniture Mart, located on a 77-acre site on 72nd Street between Dodge and Pacific, we will again be having “Berkshire Weekend” discount pricing. Last year the store did $32.7 million of business during its annual meeting sale, a volume that exceeds the yearly sales of most furniture stores. To obtain the Berkshire discount, you must make your purchases between Tuesday, May 1st and Monday, May 7th inclusive, and also present your meeting credential. Theperiod’s special pricing will even apply to the products of several prestigious manufacturers that normally have ironclad rules against discounting but which, in the spirit of our shareholder weekend, have made an exception for you. We appreciate their cooperation. NFM is open from10a.m.to9p.m.Mondaythrough Saturday,and10a.m.to6p.m.on Sunday.On Saturdaythisyear,from5:30p.m. to8p.m.,NFMishavingapicnictowhichyouareallinvited. At Borsheims, we will again have two shareholder-only events. The first will be a cocktail reception from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. on Friday, May 4th. The second, the main gala, will be held on Sunday, May 6th, from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. On Saturday, we will be open until 6 p.m. On Sunday, around 2 p.m., I will be clerking at Borsheims, desperate to beat my sales figure from last year. So come take advantage of me. Ask me for my “Crazy Warren”price. We will have huge crowds at Borsheims throughout the weekend. For your convenience, therefore, shareholder prices will be available from Monday, April 30th through Saturday, May 12th. During that period, please identify yourself as a shareholder by presenting your meeting credentials or a brokerage statement that showsyouarea Berkshireholder.

We will again have the same three financial journalists lead the question-and-answer period at the meeting, asking Charlie and me questions that shareholders have submitted to them by e-mail.
