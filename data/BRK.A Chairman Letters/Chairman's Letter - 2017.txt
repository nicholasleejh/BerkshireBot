BERKSHIREHATHAWAYINC. Tothe Shareholdersof Berkshire Hathaway Inc.: Berkshire’s gain in net worth during 2017 was $65.3 billion, which increased the per-share book value of bothour Class Aand Class Bstockby23%.Overthelast53years(thatis,sincepresentmanagementtookover),per- sharebookvaluehasgrownfrom$19to$211,750,arateof19.1%compoundedannually.* The format of that opening paragraph has been standard for 30 years. But 2017 was far from standard: A largeportionofourgaindidnotcomefromanythingweaccomplishedat Berkshire. The $65 billion gain is nonetheless real – rest assured of that. But only $36 billion came from Berkshire’s operations. The remaining $29 billion was delivered to us in December when Congress rewrote the U.S. Tax Code. (Detailsof Berkshire’stax-relatedgainappearonpage K-32andpages K-89–K-90.) After stating those fiscal facts, I would prefer to turn immediately to discussing Berkshire’s operations. But, in still another interruption, I must first tell you about a new accounting rule – a generally accepted accounting principle(GAAP)–thatinfuturequarterlyandannualreportswillseverelydistort Berkshire’snetincomefiguresand veryoftenmisleadcommentatorsandinvestors. The new rule says that the net change in unrealized investment gains and losses in stocks we hold must be included in all net income figures we report to you. That requirement will produce some truly wild and capricious swingsinour GAAPbottom-line.Berkshireowns$170billionofmarketablestocks(notincludingoursharesof Kraft Heinz), and the value of these holdings can easily swing by $10 billion or more within a quarterly reporting period. Includinggyrationsofthatmagnitudeinreportednetincomewillswampthetrulyimportantnumbersthatdescribeour operatingperformance.Foranalyticalpurposes,Berkshire’s“bottom-line”willbeuseless. The new rule compounds the communication problems we have long had in dealing with the realized gains (or losses) that accounting rules compel us to include in our net income. In past quarterly and annual press releases, wehaveregularlywarnedyounottopayattentiontotheserealizedgains,becausethey–justlikeourunrealizedgains –fluctuaterandomly. That’slargelybecausewesellsecuritieswhenthatseemstheintelligentthingtodo,notbecausewearetrying toinfluenceearningsinanyway.Asaresult,wesometimeshavereportedsubstantialrealizedgainsforaperiodwhen ourportfolio,overall,performedpoorly(ortheconverse). *All per-share figures used in this report apply to Berkshire’s A shares. Figures for the B shares are 1/1500th of those shownforthe Ashares. With the new rule about unrealized gains exacerbating the distortion caused by the existing rules applying to realized gains, we will take pains every quarter to explain the adjustments you need in order to make sense of our numbers. But televised commentary on earnings releases is often instantaneous with their receipt, and newspaper headlines almost always focus on the year-over-year change in GAAP net income. Consequently, media reports sometimeshighlightfiguresthatunnecessarilyfrightenorencouragemanyreadersorviewers. We will attempt to alleviate this problem by continuing our practice of publishing financial reports late on Friday, well after the markets close, or early on Saturday morning. That will allow you maximum time for analysis and give investment professionals the opportunity to deliver informed commentary before markets open on Monday. Nevertheless,Iexpectconsiderableconfusionamongshareholdersforwhomaccountingisaforeignlanguage. At Berkshire what counts most are increases in our normalized per-share earning power. That metric is what Charlie Munger,mylong-timepartner,and Ifocuson–andwehopethatyoudo,too.Ourscorecardfor2017follows. Acquisitions There are four building blocks that add value to Berkshire: (1) sizable stand-alone acquisitions; (2) bolt-on acquisitions that fit with businesses we already own; (3) internal sales growth and margin improvement at our many and varied businesses; and (4) investment earnings from our huge portfolio of stocks and bonds. In this section, we willreview2017acquisitionactivity. In our search for new stand-alone businesses, the key qualities we seek are durable competitive strengths; able and high-grade management; good returns on the net tangible assets required to operate the business; opportunitiesforinternalgrowthatattractivereturns;and,finally,asensiblepurchaseprice. That last requirement proved a barrier to virtually all deals wereviewedin2017,asprices fordecent,butfar from spectacular, businesses hit an all-time high. Indeed, price seemed almost irrelevant to an army of optimistic purchasers. Why the purchasing frenzy? In part, it’s because the CEO job self-selects for “can-do” types. If Wall Street analystsorboardmembersurgethatbrandof CEOtoconsiderpossibleacquisitions,it’sabitliketellingyourripening teenagertobesuretohaveanormalsexlife. Oncea CEOhungersforadeal,heorshewillneverlackforforecasts thatjustifythepurchase.Subordinates will be cheering, envisioning enlarged domains and the compensation levels that typically increase with corporate size. Investment bankers, smelling huge fees, will be applauding as well. (Don’t ask the barber whether you need a haircut.) If the historical performance of the target falls short of validating its acquisition, large “synergies” will be forecast.Spreadsheetsneverdisappoint. The ample availability of extraordinarily cheap debt in 2017 further fueled purchase activity. After all, even a high-priced deal will usually boost per-share earnings if it is debt-financed. At Berkshire, in contrast, we evaluate acquisitionsonanall-equitybasis,knowingthatourtasteforoveralldebtisverylowandthattoassignalargeportion of our debt to any individual business would generally be fallacious (leaving aside certain exceptions, such as debt dedicated to Clayton’s lending portfolio or to the fixed-asset commitments at our regulated utilities). We also never factorin,nordoweoftenfind,synergies. Our aversion to leverage has dampened our returns over the years. But Charlie and I sleep well. Both of us believeitisinsanetoriskwhatyouhaveandneedinordertoobtainwhatyoudon’tneed.Weheldthisview50years ago when we each ran an investment partnership, funded by a few friends and relatives who trusted us. We also hold ittodayafteramillionorso“partners”havejoinedusat Berkshire. Despite our recent drought of acquisitions, Charlie and I believe that from time to time Berkshire will have opportunities to make very large purchases. In the meantime, we will stick with our simple guideline: The less the prudencewithwhichothersconducttheiraffairs,thegreatertheprudencewithwhichwemustconductourown.   Wewereabletomakeonesensiblestand-alonepurchaselastyear,a38.6%partnershipinterestin Pilot Flying J (“PFJ”). With about $20 billion in annual volume, the company is far and away the nation’s leading travel-center operator. PFJ has been run from the get-go by the remarkable Haslam family. “Big Jim” Haslam began with a dream and a gas station 60 years ago. Now his son, Jimmy, manages 27,000 associates at about 750 locations throughout North America. Berkshire has a contractual agreement to increase its partnership interest in PFJ to 80% in 2023; Haslamfamilymemberswillthenowntheremaining20%.Berkshireisdelightedtobetheirpartner. When driving on the Interstate, drop in. PFJ sells gasoline as well as diesel fuel, and the food is good. If it’s beenalongday,remember,too,thatourpropertieshave5,200showers.   Let’s move now to bolt-on acquisitions. Some of these were small transactions that I will not detail. Here is anaccount,however,ofafewlargerpurchaseswhoseclosingsstretchedbetweenlate2016andearly2018. Š Clayton Homes acquired two builders of conventional homes during 2017, a move that more than doubled our presence in a field we entered only three years ago. With these additions – Oakwood Homes in Colorado and Harris Doylein Birmingham–Iexpectour2018sitebuiltvolumewillexceed$1billion. Clayton’s emphasis, nonetheless, remains manufactured homes, both their construction and their financing. In2017Claytonsold19,168unitsthroughitsownretailoperationandwholesaledanother26,706unitstoindependent retailers. Alltold,Claytonaccounted for49%ofthemanufactured-home marketlastyear.Thatindustry-leading share – about three times what our nearest competitor did – is a far cry from the 13% Clayton achieved in 2003, the year it joined Berkshire. Both Clayton Homesand PFJarebasedin Knoxville,wherethe Claytonand Haslamfamilieshavelongbeen friends. Kevin Clayton’s comments to the Haslams about the advantages of a Berkshire affiliation, and his admiring commentsaboutthe Haslamfamilytome,helpedcementthe PFJdeal. Š Near the end of 2016, Shaw Industries, our floor coverings business, acquired U.S. Floors (“USF”), a rapidly growing distributor of luxury vinyl tile. USF’s managers, Piet Dossche and Philippe Erramuzpe, came out of the gate fast, delivering a 40% increase in sales in 2017, during which their operation was integrated with Shaw’s. It’s clear thatweacquiredbothgreathumanassetsandbusinessassetsinmakingthe USFpurchase. Vance Bell, Shaw’s CEO, originated, negotiated and completed this acquisition, which increased Shaw’s sales to $5.7 billion in 2017 and its employment to 22,000. With the purchase of USF, Shaw has substantially strengtheneditspositionasanimportantanddurablesourceofearningsfor Berkshire. Š I have told you several times about Home Services, our growing real estate brokerage operation. Berkshire backedintothisbusinessin2000whenweacquiredamajorityinterestin Mid American Energy(nownamed Berkshire Hathaway Energy). Mid American’s activities were then largely in the electric utility field, and I originally paid little attentionto Home Services. But,year-by-year,thecompanyaddedbrokersand,bytheendof2016,Home Serviceswasthesecond-largest brokerage operation in the country – still ranking, though, far behind the leader, Realogy. In 2017, however, Home Services’ growth exploded. We acquired the industry’s third-largest operator, Long and Foster; number 12, Houlihan Lawrence;and Gloria Nilson. With those purchases we added 12,300 agents, raising our total to 40,950. Home Services is now close to leading the country in home sales, having participated (including our three acquisitions pro-forma) in $127 billion of “sides” during 2017. To explain that term, there are two “sides” to every transaction; if we represent both buyer and seller,thedollarvalueofthetransactioniscountedtwice. Despite its recent acquisitions, Home Services is on track to do only about 3% of the country’s home- brokerage business in 2018. That leaves 97% to go. Given sensible prices, we will keep adding brokers in this most fundamentalofbusinesses. Š Finally, Precision Castparts, a company built through acquisitions, bought Wilhelm Schulz Gmb H, a German maker of corrosion resistant fittings, piping systems and components. Please allow me to skip a further explanation. I don’t understand manufacturing operations as well as I do the activities of real estate brokers, home buildersortruckstops. Fortunately, I don’t need in this instance to bring knowledge to the table: Mark Donegan, CEO of Precision, is an extraordinary manufacturing executive, and any business in his domain is slated to do well. Betting on people cansometimesbemorecertainthanbettingonphysicalassets. Let’s now move on to operations, beginning with property-casualty (“p/c”) insurance, a business I do understandandtheenginethatfor51yearshaspowered Berkshire’sgrowth. Insurance Before I discuss our 2017 insurance results, let me remind you of how and why we entered the field. We began by purchasing National Indemnity and a smaller sister company for $8.6 million in early 1967. With our purchase we received $6.7million of tangible net worth that, bythe nature of the insurance business, wewere able to deployinmarketablesecurities.Itwaseasytorearrangetheportfoliointosecuritieswewouldotherwisehaveownedat Berkshireitself.Ineffect,wewere“tradingdollars”forthenetworthportionofthecost. The $1.9 million premium over net worth that Berkshire paid brought us an insurance business that usually delivered anunderwriting profit. Evenmoreimportant, theinsurance operation carried withit$19.4million of“float” –moneythatbelongedtoothersbutwasheldbyourtwoinsurers. Ever since, float has been of great importance to Berkshire. When we invest these funds, all dividends, interest and gains from their deployment belong to Berkshire. (If we experience investment losses, those, of course, areonourtabaswell.) Float materializes at p/c insurers in several ways: (1) Premiums are generally paid to the company upfront whereaslossesoccuroverthelifeofthepolicy,usuallyasix-monthorone-yearperiod;(2)Thoughsomelosses,such as car repairs, are quickly paid, others – such as the harm caused by exposure to asbestos – may take many years to surface and even longer to evaluate and settle; (3) Loss payments are sometimes spread over decades in cases, say, of a person employed by one of our workers’ compensation policyholders being permanently injured and thereafter requiringexpensivelifetimecare. Float generally grows as premium volume increases. Additionally, certain p/c insurers specialize in lines of business such as medical malpractice or product liability – business labeled “long-tail” in industry jargon – that generatefarmorefloatthan,say,autocollisionandhomeownerpolicies,whichrequireinsurerstoalmostimmediately makepaymentstoclaimantsforneededrepairs. Berkshire has been a leader in long-tail business for many years. In particular, we have specialized in jumbo reinsurance policies that leave us assuming long-tail losses already incurred by other p/c insurers. As a result of our emphasizingthatsortofbusiness,Berkshire’sgrowthinfloathasbeenextraordinary.Wearenowthecountry’ssecond largestp/ccompanymeasuredbypremiumvolumeanditsleader,byfar,infloat. Here’stherecord: (in$millions) Year Premium Volume Float 1970 $ 39 $ 39 1980 185 237 1990 582 1,632 2000 19,343 27,871 2010 30,749 65,832 2017 60,597 114,500 Our2017volume wasboosted by a huge deal in which wereinsured upto$20billion oflong-tail losses that AIG had incurred. Our premium for this policy was $10.2 billion, a world’s record and one we won’t come close to repeating.Premiumvolumewillthereforefallsomewhatin2018. Float will probably increase slowly for at least a few years. When weeventually experience a decline, it will be modest – at most 3% or so in any single year. Unlike bank deposits or life insurance policies containing surrender options, p/c float can’t be withdrawn. This means that p/c companies can’t experience massive “runs” in times of widespread financial stress, a characteristic of prime importance to Berkshire that we factor into our investment decisions. Charlie and I never will operate Berkshire in a manner that depends on the kindness of strangers – or even that of friends who may be facing liquidity problems of their own. During the 2008-2009 crisis, we liked having Treasury Bills – loads of Treasury Bills –that protected us from having to rely on funding sources such as bank lines or commercial paper. We have intentionally constructed Berkshire in a manner that will allow it to comfortably withstandeconomicdiscontinuities,includingsuchextremesasextendedmarketclosures.   Thedownsideoffloatisthatitcomeswithrisk,sometimesoceansofrisk.Whatlookspredictableininsurance can be anything but. Take the famous Lloyds insurance market, which produced decent results for three centuries. In the 1980’s, though, huge latent problems from a few long-tail lines of insurance surfaced at Lloyds and, for a time, threatenedtodestroyitsstoriedoperation.(Ithas,Ishouldadd,fullyrecovered.) Berkshire’s insurance managers are conservative and careful underwriters, who operate in a culture that has longprioritizedthosequalities.Thatdisciplinedbehaviorhasproducedunderwritingprofitsinmostyears,andinsuch instances, our cost of float was less than zero. In effect, we got paid then for holding the huge sums tallied in the earliertable. Ihavewarnedyou,however,thatwehavebeenfortunateinrecentyearsandthatthecatastrophe-light period the industry was experiencing was not a new norm. Last September drove home that point, as three significant hurricaneshit Texas,Floridaand Puerto Rico. Myguessatthistimeisthattheinsuredlossesarisingfromthehurricanesare$100billionorso.Thatfigure, however, could be far off the mark. The pattern with most mega-catastrophes has been that initial loss estimates ran low. As well-known analyst V.J. Dowling has pointed out, the loss reserves of an insurer are similar to a self-graded exam. Ignorance, wishful thinking or, occasionally, downright fraud can deliver inaccurate figures about an insurer’s financialconditionforaverylongtime. We currently estimate Berkshire’s losses from the three hurricanes to be $3 billion (or about $2 billion after tax).Ifboththatestimate andmyindustryestimate of$100billionareclosetoaccurate,ourshareoftheindustryloss was about 3%. I believe that percentage is also what we may reasonably expect to be our share of losses in future Americanmega-cats. It’s worth noting that the $2 billion net cost from the three hurricanes reduced Berkshire’s GAAP net worth by less than 1%. Elsewhere in the reinsurance industry there were many companies that suffered losses in net worth ranging from 7% to more than 15%. The damage to them could have been far worse: Had Hurricane Irma followed a paththrough Floridaonlyabittotheeast,insuredlossesmightwellhavebeenanadditional$100billion. We believe that the annual probability of a U.S. mega-catastrophe causing $400 billion or more of insured losses is about 2%. No one, of course, knows the correct probability. We do know, however, that the risk increases overtimebecauseofgrowthinboththenumberandvalueofstructureslocatedincatastrophe-vulnerableareas. No company comes close to Berkshire in being financially prepared for a $400 billion mega-cat. Our share of such a loss might be $12 billion or so, an amount far below the annual earnings we expect from our non-insurance activities. Concurrently, much – indeed, perhaps most – of the p/c world would be out of business. Our unparalleled financial strength explains why other p/c insurers come to Berkshire – and only Berkshire – when they, themselves, needtopurchasehugereinsurancecoveragesforlargepaymentstheymayhavetomakeinthefarfuture. Prior to 2017, Berkshire had recorded 14 consecutive years of underwriting profits, which totaled $28.3 billion pre-tax. Ihaveregularly toldyouthat Iexpect Berkshiretoattainanunderwritingprofitinamajority ofyears, butalsotoexperience losses from time totime. Mywarningbecame fact in2017,aswelost$3.2billionpre-taxfrom underwriting. A large amount of additional information about our various insurance operations is included in the 10-K at the back of this report. The only point I will add here is that you have some extraordinary managers working for you at our various p/c operations. This is a business in which there are no trade secrets, patents, or locational advantages.

BNSF, our railroad, and Berkshire Hathaway Energy (of which we own 90.2%). You can read more aboutthesebusinessesonpages K-5–K-10andpages K-40–K-44. Proceeding down Berkshire’s long list of subsidiaries, our next five non-insurance businesses, as ranked by earnings (but presented here alphabetically) Clayton Homes, International Metalworking Companies, Lubrizol, Marmon and Precision Castparts had aggregate pre-tax income in 2017 of $5.5 billion, little changed from the $5.4 billionthesecompaniesearnedin2016. The next five, similarly ranked and listed (Forest River, Johns Manville, Mi Tek, Shaw and TTI) earned $2.1 billionlastyear,upfrom$1.7billionin2016. The remaining businesses that Berkshire owns – and there are many – recorded little change in pre-tax income,whichwas$3.7billionin2017versus$3.5billionin2016. Depreciation charges for all of these non-insurance operations totaled $7.6 billion; capital expenditures were $11.5 billion. Berkshire is always looking for ways to expand its businesses and regularly incurs capital expenditures that far exceed its depreciation charge. Almost 90% of our investments are made in the United States. America’s economicsoilremainsfertile. Amortization charges were an additional $1.3 billion. I believe that in large part this item is not a true economic cost. Partially offsetting this good news is the fact that BNSF (like all other railroads) records depreciation chargesthatfallwellshortofthesumsregularlyneededtokeeptherailroadinfirst-classshape.

Overall – and over time – we should get decent results.In America,equityinvestorshavethewindattheirback. From our stock portfolio – call our holdings “minority interests” in a diversified group of publicly-owned businesses – Berkshire received $3.7 billion of dividends in 2017. That’s the number included in our GAAP figures, aswellasinthe“operatingearnings”wereferenceinourquarterlyandannualreports. That dividend figure, however, far understates the “true” earnings emanating from our stock holdings. For decades, we have stated in Principle 6 of our “Owner-Related Business Principles” (page 19) that we expect undistributedearningsofourinvesteestodeliverusatleastequivalentearningsbywayofsubsequentcapitalgains. Our recognition of capital gains (and losses) will be lumpy, particularly as we conform with the new GAAP rule requiring us to constantly record unrealized gains or losses in our earnings. I feel confident, however, that the earnings retained by our investees will over time, and with our investees viewed as a group, translate into commensuratecapitalgainsfor Berkshire. The connection of value-building to retained earnings that I’ve just described will be impossible to detect in the short term. Stocks surge and swoon, seemingly untethered to any year-to-year buildup in their underlying value. Over time, however, Ben Graham’s oft-quoted maxim proves true: “In the short run, the market is a voting machine; inthelongrun,however,itbecomesaweighingmachine.”   Berkshire, itself, provides some vivid examples of howprice randomness intheshortterm canobscurelong- term growth in value. For the last 53 years, the company has built value by reinvesting its earnings and letting compound interest work its magic. Year by year, we have moved forward. Yet Berkshire shares have suffered four trulymajordips.Herearethegorydetails: Period High Low Percentage Decrease March1973-January1975 93 38 (59.1%) 10/2/87-10/27/87 4,250 2,675 (37.1%) 6/19/98-3/10/2000 80,900 41,300 (48.9%) 9/19/08-3/5/09 147,000 72,400 (50.7%) This table offers the strongest argument I can muster against ever using borrowed money to own stocks.

(The full discussion from last year’s annual report is reprinted on pages 24 – 26.) Now I have the final tally – and, in severalrespects,it’saneye-opener. I made the bet for two reasons: (1) to leverage my outlay of $318,250 into a disproportionately larger sum that – if things turned out as I expected – would be distributed in early 2018 to Girls Inc. of Omaha; and (2) to publicizemyconvictionthatmypick–avirtuallycost-freeinvestmentinanunmanaged S&P500indexfund–would, over time, deliver better results than those achieved by most investment professionals, however well-regarded and incentivizedthose“helpers”maybe. Addressing this question is of enormous importance. American investors pay staggering sums annually to advisors, often incurring several layers of consequential costs. In the aggregate, do these investors get their money’s worth?Indeed,againintheaggregate,doinvestorsgetanythingfortheiroutlays? Protégé Partners, my counterparty to the bet, picked five “funds-of-funds” that it expected to overperform the S&P500.That was not a small sample. Thosefivefunds-of-funds inturnownedinterests inmorethan200hedge funds. Essentially, Protégé, an advisory firm that knew its way around Wall Street, selected five investment experts who, in turn, employed several hundred other investment experts, each managing his or her own hedge fund. This assemblagewasanelitecrew,loadedwithbrains,adrenalineandconfidence. The managers of the five funds-of-funds possessed a further advantage: They could – and did – rearrange their portfolios of hedge funds during the ten years, investing with new “stars” while exiting their positions in hedge fundswhosemanagershadlosttheirtouch. Every actor on Protégé’s side was highly incentivized: Both the fund-of-funds managers and the hedge-fund managers they selected significantly shared in gains, even those achieved simply because the market generally moves upwards. (In 100% of the 43 ten-year periods since we took control of Berkshire, years with gains by the S&P 500 exceededlossyears.) Those performance incentives, it should be emphasized, were frosting on a huge and tasty cake: Even if the fundslostmoneyfortheirinvestorsduringthedecade,theirmanagerscouldgrowveryrich.Thatwouldoccurbecause fixed fees averaging a staggering 21⁄ 2%ofassets orsowerepaideveryyearbythefund-of-funds’ investors, withpart of these fees going to the managers at the five funds-of-funds and the balance going to the 200-plus managers of the underlyinghedgefunds.

I, however, have received their annual audits from Protégé. The 2016 figures for funds A, B and C were revised slightly from those originally reported last year. Fund D was liquidated in 2017; its averageannualgainiscalculatedforthenineyearsofitsoperation. The five funds-of-funds got off to a fast start, each beating the index fund in 2008. Then the roof fell in. In everyoneofthenineyearsthatfollowed,thefunds-of-fundsasawholetrailedtheindexfund. Let me emphasize that there was nothing aberrational about stock-market behavior over the ten-year stretch. If a poll of investment “experts” had been asked late in 2007 for a forecast of long-term common-stock returns, their guesses would have likely averaged close to the 8.5% actually delivered by the S&P 500. Making money in that environment should have been easy. Indeed, Wall Street “helpers” earned staggering sums. While this group prospered,however,manyoftheirinvestorsexperiencedalostdecade. Performancecomes,performancegoes.Feesneverfalter.   The bet illuminated another important investment lesson: Though markets are generally rational, they occasionally do crazy things. Seizing the opportunities then offered does not require great intelligence, a degree in economics or a familiarity with Wall Street jargon such as alpha and beta. What investors then need instead is an ability to both disregard mob fears or enthusiasms and to focus on a few simple fundamentals. A willingness to look unimaginativeforasustainedperiod–oreventolookfoolish–isalsoessential. Originally, Protégé and I each funded our portion of the ultimate $1 million prize by purchasing $500,000 faceamountofzero-coupon U.S.Treasurybonds(sometimes called“strips”).Thesebondscosteachofus$318,250– abitlessthan64¢onthedollar–withthe$500,000payableintenyears. Asthenameimplies, thebondsweacquiredpaidnointerest,but(becauseofthediscountatwhichtheywere purchased) delivered a 4.56% annual return if held to maturity. Protégé and I originally intended to do no more than tallytheannualreturnsanddistribute$1milliontothewinningcharitywhenthebondsmaturedlatein2017. After our purchase, however, some very strange things took place in the bond market. By November 2012, our bonds –nowwith about five years togobefore theymatured –wereselling for95.7%oftheir facevalue.Atthat price,theirannualyieldtomaturitywaslessthan1%.Or,tobeprecise,.88%. Given that pathetic return, our bonds had become a dumb – a really dumb – investment compared to American equities. Overtime, the S&P500–whichmirrors ahugecross-section of American business, appropriately weightedbymarketvalue–hasearnedfarmorethan10%annuallyonshareholders’equity(networth). In November2012,aswewereconsideringallthis,thecashreturnfromdividendsonthe S&P500was21⁄ 2% annually, about triple the yield on our U.S. Treasury bond. These dividend payments were almost certain to grow. Beyond that, huge sums were being retained by the companies comprising the 500. These businesses would use their retained earnings to expand their operations and, frequently, to repurchase their shares as well. Either course would, overtime,substantially increaseearnings-per-share. And–ashasbeenthecasesince1776–whateveritsproblemsof theminute,the Americaneconomywasgoingtomoveforward. Presented late in 2012 with the extraordinary valuation mismatch between bonds and equities, Protégé and I agreed to sell the bonds we had bought five years earlier and use the proceeds to buy 11,200 Berkshire “B” shares. Theresult:Girls Inc.of Omahafounditselfreceiving$2,222,279lastmonthratherthanthe$1millionithadoriginally hopedfor. Berkshire, it should be emphasized, has not performed brilliantly since the 2012 substitution. But brilliance wasn’t needed: After all, Berkshire’s gain only had to beat that annual.88% bond bogey – hardly a Herculean achievement. The only risk in the bonds-to-Berkshire switch was that yearend 2017 would coincide with an exceptionally weak stock market. Protégé and I felt this possibility (which always exists) was very low. Two factors dictated this conclusion:Thereasonablepriceof Berkshireinlate2012,andthelargeassetbuild-upthatwasalmostcertaintooccur at Berkshire during the five years that remained before the bet would be settled. Even so, to eliminate all risk to the charities from the switch, I agreed to make up any shortfall if sales of the 11,200 Berkshire shares at yearend 2017 didn’tproduceatleast$1million.   Investing is an activity in which consumption today is foregone in an attempt to allow greater consumption atalaterdate.“Risk”isthepossibilitythatthisobjectivewon’tbeattained. By that standard, purportedly “risk-free” long-term bonds in 2012 were a far riskier investment than a long- term investment in common stocks. At that time, even a 1% annual rate of inflation between 2012 and 2017 would havedecreasedthepurchasing-powerofthegovernmentbondthat Protégéand Isold. I want to quickly acknowledge that in any upcoming day, week or even year, stocks will be riskier – far riskier – than short-term U.S. bonds. As an investor’s investment horizon lengthens, however, a diversified portfolio of U.S. equities becomes progressively less risky than bonds, assuming that the stocks are purchased at a sensible multipleofearningsrelativetothen-prevailinginterestrates. It is a terrible mistake for investors with long-term horizons – among them, pension funds, college endowments and savings-minded individuals – to measure their investment “risk” by their portfolio’s ratio of bonds tostocks.Often,high-gradebondsinaninvestmentportfolioincreaseitsrisk.   A final lesson from our bet: Stick with big, “easy” decisions and eschew activity. During the ten-year bet, the 200-plus hedge-fund managers that were involved almost certainly made tens of thousands of buy and sell decisions.Mostofthosemanagersundoubtedlythoughthardabouttheirdecisions,eachofwhichtheybelievedwould prove advantageous. In the process of investing, they studied 10-Ks, interviewed managements, read trade journals andconferredwith Wall Streetanalysts. Protégé and I, meanwhile, leaning neither on research, insights nor brilliance, made only one investment decisionduringthetenyears.Wesimplydecidedtosellourbondinvestmentatapriceofmorethan100timesearnings (95.7saleprice/.88yield),thosebeing“earnings”thatcouldnotincreaseduringtheensuingfiveyears.

At Nebraska Furniture Mart, located on a 77-acre site on 72nd Street between Dodge and Pacific, we will again be having “Berkshire Weekend” discount pricing. To obtain the Berkshire discount at NFM, you must make your purchases between Tuesday, May 1st and Monday, May 7th inclusive, and must also present your meeting credential. Last year, the one-week volume for the store was a staggering $44.6 million. Bricks and mortar are alive andwellat NFM. The period’s special pricing will even apply to the products of several prestigious manufacturers that normally have ironclad rules against discounting but which, in the spirit of our shareholder weekend, have made an exception for you. We appreciate their cooperation. During “Berkshire Weekend,” NFMwill be open from 10a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday through Saturday and 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. on Sunday.

While I’m on the subject of our owners’ gaining knowledge, let me remind you that Charlie and I believe all shareholders should simultaneously have access to newinformation that Berkshire releases and,ifpossible, should also have adequate time to digest and analyze that information before any trading takes place. That’s why we try to issue financial data late on Fridays orearly on Saturdays andwhyourannualmeeting isalwaysheldona Saturday(a daythatalsoeasestrafficandparkingproblems). We do not follow the common practice of talking one-on-one with large institutional investors or analysts, treating them instead as we do all other shareholders. There is no one more important to us than the shareholder of limited means who trusts us with a substantial portion of his or her savings.

This team efficiently deals with a multitude of SEC and other regulatory requirements, files a 32,700-page Federal income tax return, oversees the filing of 3,935 state tax returns, responds to countless shareholder and media inquiries, gets out the annual report, prepares for the country’s largest annual meeting, coordinates the Board’s activities, fact-checks this letter – and the list goes on and on. They handle all of these business tasks cheerfully and with unbelievable efficiency, making my life easy and pleasant. Their efforts go beyond activities strictly related to Berkshire: Last year, for example, they dealt with the 40 universities (selected from 200 applicants) who sent students to Omaha for a Q&A day with me.
