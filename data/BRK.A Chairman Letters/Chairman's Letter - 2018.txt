BERKSHIREHATHAWAYINC. Tothe Shareholdersof Berkshire Hathaway Inc.: Berkshire earned $4.0 billion in 2018 utilizing generally accepted accounting principles (commonly called “GAAP”). The components of that figure are $24.8 billion in operating earnings, a $3.0 billion non-cash loss from an impairment of intangible assets (arising almost entirely from our equity interest in Kraft Heinz), $2.8 billion in realized capitalgainsfromthesaleofinvestmentsecuritiesanda$20.6billionlossfromareductionintheamountofunrealized capitalgainsthatexistedinourinvestmentholdings. Anew GAAPrulerequiresustoincludethatlastiteminearnings.As Iemphasizedinthe2017annualreport, neither Berkshire’s Vice Chairman, Charlie Munger, nor I believe that rule to be sensible. Rather, both of us have consistently thought that at Berkshire this mark-to-market change would produce what I described as “wild and capriciousswingsinourbottomline.” The accuracy of that prediction can be suggested by our quarterly results during 2018. In the first and fourth quarters, we reported GAAPlosses of $1.1 billion and $25.4 billion respectively. In the second and third quarters,we reported profits of $12 billion and $18.5 billion. In complete contrast to these gyrations, the many businesses that Berkshire owns delivered consistent and satisfactory operating earnings in all quarters. For the year, those earnings exceededtheir2016highof$17.6billionby41%. Wide swings in our quarterly GAAP earnings will inevitably continue. That’s because our huge equity portfolio – valued at nearly $173 billion at the end of 2018 – will often experience one-day price fluctuations of $2 billion or more, all of which the new rule says must be dropped immediately to our bottom line. Indeed, in the fourth quarter, a period of high volatility in stock prices, we experienced several days with a “profit” or “loss” of more than $4billion. Our advice? Focus on operating earnings, paying little attention to gains or losses of any variety. My saying that in no way diminishes the importance of our investments to Berkshire. Over time, Charlie and I expect them to deliversubstantialgains,albeitwithhighlyirregulartiming.   Long-time readers of our annual reports will have spotted thedifferent wayinwhich Iopenedthisletter. For nearly three decades, the initial paragraph featured the percentage change in Berkshire’s per-share book value. It’s nowtimetoabandonthatpractice. The fact is that the annual change in Berkshire’s book value – which makes its farewell appearance on page 2 – is a metric that has lost the relevance it once had. Three circumstances have made that so. First, Berkshire has gradually morphed from a company whose assets are concentrated in marketable stocks into one whose major value resides in operating businesses. Charlie and I expect that reshaping to continue in an irregular manner. Second, while our equity holdings are valued at market prices, accounting rules require our collection of operating companies to be included in bookvalue at an amount far below their current value, a mismark that has grownin recent years.Third,it is likely that –over time –Berkshire will be a significant repurchaser of its shares, transactions that will take place at prices above book value but below our estimate of intrinsic value. The math of such purchases is simple: Each transaction makes per-share intrinsic value go up, while per-share book value goes down. That combination causes thebook-valuescorecardtobecomeincreasinglyoutoftouchwitheconomicreality. In future tabulations of our financial results, we expect to focus on Berkshire’s market price. Markets can be extremely capricious: Just look at the 54-year history laid out on page 2. Over time, however, Berkshire’s stock price willprovidethebestmeasureofbusinessperformance.   Before moving on, I want to give you some good news – really good news – that is not reflected in our financial statements. It concerns the management changes we made in early 2018, when Ajit Jain was put in charge of all insurance activities and Greg Abel was given authority over all other operations. These moves were overdue. Berkshire is now far better managed than when I alone was supervising operations. Ajit and Greg have rare talents, and Berkshirebloodflowsthroughtheirveins. Nowlet’stakealookatwhatyouown. Focusonthe Forest–Forgetthe Trees Investors who evaluate Berkshire sometimes obsess on the details of our many and diverse businesses – our economic “trees,” so to speak. Analysis of that type can be mind-numbing, given that we own a vast array of specimens, ranging from twigs to redwoods. A few of our trees are diseased and unlikely to be around a decade from now.Manyothers,though,aredestinedtogrowinsizeandbeauty. Fortunately, it’s not necessary to evaluate each tree individually to make a rough estimate of Berkshire’s intrinsic business value. That’s because our forest contains five “groves” of major importance, each of which can be appraised, with reasonable accuracy, in its entirety. Four of those groves are differentiated clusters of businesses and financialassetsthatareeasytounderstand.Thefifth–ourhugeanddiverseinsuranceoperation–deliversgreatvalue to Berkshireinalessobviousmanner,one Iwillexplainlaterinthisletter. Before we look more closely at the first four groves, let me remind you of our prime goal in the deployment of your capital: to buy ably-managed businesses, in whole or part, that possess favorable and durable economic characteristics.Wealsoneedtomakethesepurchasesatsensibleprices. Sometimes we can buy control of companies that meet our tests. Far more often, we find the attributes we seek in publicly-traded businesses, in which we normally acquire a 5% to 10% interest. Ourtwo-pronged approach to huge-scalecapitalallocationisrareincorporate Americaand,attimes,givesusanimportantadvantage. In recent years, the sensible course for us to follow has been clear: Many stocks have offered far more for our money than we could obtain by purchasing businesses in their entirety. That disparity led us to buy about $43 billion of marketable equities last year, while selling only $19 billion. Charlie and I believe the companies in which weinvestedofferedexcellentvalue,farexceedingthatavailableintakeovertransactions. Despiteourrecentadditionstomarketable equities,themostvaluablegrovein Berkshire’s forestremainsthe many dozens of non-insurance businesses that Berkshire controls (usually with 100% ownership and never with less than80%).Thosesubsidiariesearned$16.8billionlastyear.Whenwesay“earned,”moreover,wearedescribingwhat remains after all income taxes, interest payments, managerial compensation (whether cash or stock-based), restructuringexpenses,depreciation,amortizationandhome-officeoverhead. That brand of earnings is a far cry from that frequently touted by Wall Street bankers and corporate CEOs. Too often, their presentations feature “adjusted EBITDA,” a measure that redefines “earnings” to exclude a variety of all-too-realcosts. For example, managements sometimes assert that their company’s stock-based compensation shouldn’t be counted as an expense. (What else could it be – a gift from shareholders?) And restructuring expenses? Well, maybe last year’s exact rearrangement won’t recur. But restructurings of one sort or another are common in business – Berkshirehasgonedownthatroaddozensoftimes,andourshareholdershavealwaysbornethecostsofdoingso. Abraham Lincoln once posed the question: “If you call a dog’s tail a leg, how many legs does it have?” and then answered his own query: “Four, because calling a tail a leg doesn’t make it one.” Abe would have felt lonely on Wall Street. Charlie and I do contend that our acquisition-related amortization expenses of $1.4 billion (detailed on page K-84)arenotatrueeconomiccost.Weaddbacksuchamortization“costs”to GAAPearningswhenweareevaluating bothprivatebusinessesandmarketablestocks. In contrast, Berkshire’s $8.4 billion depreciation charge understates our true economic cost. In fact, we need to spend more than this sum annually to simply remain competitive in our many operations. Beyond those “maintenance” capital expenditures, we spend large sums in pursuit of growth. Overall, Berkshire invested a record $14.5billionlastyearinplant,equipmentandotherfixedassets,with89%ofthatspentin America. Berkshire’s runner-up grovebyvalueisitscollection ofequities,typicallyinvolvinga5%to10%ownership position in a very large company.

Eventually,however,gainsgeneratetaxesatwhateverrateprevailsatthetimeofsale. Ourinvesteespaidusdividendsof$3.8billionlastyear,asumthatwillincreasein2019.Farmoreimportant than the dividends, though, are the huge earnings that are annually retained by these companies.

(2) Basedon2018earningsminuscommonandpreferreddividendspaid. GAAP – which dictates the earnings we report – does not allow us to include the retained earnings of investees in our financial accounts. But those earnings are of enormous value to us: Over the years, earnings retained by our investees (viewed as a group) have eventually delivered capital gains to Berkshire that totaled more than one dollarforeachdollarthesecompaniesreinvestedforus. All of our major holdings enjoy excellent economics, and most use a portion of their retained earnings to repurchase their shares. We very much like that: If Charlie and I think an investee’s stock is underpriced, we rejoice whenmanagementemployssomeofitsearningstoincrease Berkshire’sownershippercentage. Here’s one example drawn from the table above: Berkshire’s holdings of American Express have remained unchanged over the past eight years. Meanwhile, our ownership increased from 12.6% to 17.9% because of repurchases madebythecompany.Lastyear,Berkshire’s portionofthe$6.9billionearnedby American Expresswas $1.2 billion, about 96% of the $1.3 billion we paid for our stake in the company. When earnings increase and shares outstandingdecrease,owners–overtime–usuallydowell. A third category of Berkshire’s business ownership is a quartet of companies in which weshare control with other parties. Our portion of the after-tax operating earnings of these businesses – 26.7% of Kraft Heinz, 50% of Berkadiaand Electric Transmission Texas,and38.6%of Pilot Flying J–totaledabout$1.3billionin2018. In our fourth grove, Berkshire held $112 billion at yearend in U.S. Treasury bills and other cash equivalents, and another $20 billion in miscellaneous fixed-income instruments. We consider a portion of that stash to be untouchable,havingpledgedtoalwaysholdatleast$20billionincashequivalentstoguardagainstexternalcalamities. Wehavealsopromisedtoavoidanyactivitiesthatcouldthreatenourmaintainingthatbuffer. Berkshire will forever remain a financial fortress.

At times, our stockwilltumbleasinvestorsfleefromequities.But Iwillneverriskgettingcaughtshortofcash. In the years ahead, we hope to move much of our excess liquidity into businesses that Berkshire will permanently own. The immediate prospects for that, however, are not good: Prices are sky-high for businesses possessingdecentlong-termprospects. That disappointing reality means that 2019 will likely see us again expanding our holdings of marketable equities.Wecontinue,nevertheless, tohopeforanelephant-sized acquisition. Evenatouragesof88and95–I’mthe young one – that prospect is what causes my heart and Charlie’s to beat faster. (Just writing about the possibility of a hugepurchasehascausedmypulseratetosoar.)

Our thinking, rather, isfocusedoncalculatingwhetheraportionofanattractivebusinessisworthmorethanitsmarketprice.   I believe Berkshire’s intrinsic value can be approximated by summing the values of our four asset-laden grovesandthensubtractinganappropriateamountfortaxeseventuallypayableonthesaleofmarketablesecurities.

Theinterestcostonallofourdebthasbeendeductedasanexpenseincalculatingtheearningsat Berkshire’s non-insurance businesses. Beyond that, much of our ownership of the first four groves is financed byfunds generated from Berkshire’s fifth grove – a collection of exceptional insurance companies. We call those funds “float,” a source of financing that we expect to be cost-free – or maybe even better than that – over time. We will explain the characteristicsoffloatlaterinthisletter. Finally, a point of key and lasting importance: Berkshire’s value is maximized by our having assembled the five groves into a single entity. This arrangement allows us to seamlessly and objectively allocate major amounts of capital, eliminate enterprise risk, avoid insularity, fund assets at exceptionally low cost, occasionally take advantage oftaxefficiencies,andminimizeoverhead. At Berkshire,thewholeisgreater–considerablygreater–thanthesumoftheparts. Repurchasesand Reporting Earlier I mentioned that Berkshire will from time to time be repurchasing its own stock. Assuming that we buy at a discount to Berkshire’s intrinsic value – which certainly will be our intention – repurchases will benefit both thoseshareholdersleavingthecompanyandthosewhostay. True, the upside from repurchases is very slight for those who are leaving. That’s because careful buying by us will minimize any impact on Berkshire’s stock price. Nevertheless, there is some benefit to sellers in having an extrabuyerinthemarket. For continuing shareholders, the advantage is obvious: If the market prices a departing partner’s interest at, say, 90¢ on the dollar, continuing shareholders reap an increase in per-share intrinsic value with every repurchase by the company. Obviously, repurchases should be price-sensitive: Blindly buying an overpriced stock is value- destructive,afactlostonmanypromotionalorever-optimistic CEOs. When a company says that it contemplates repurchases, it’s vital that all shareholder-partners be given the information they need to make an intelligent estimate of value. Providing that information is what Charlie and I try to do in this report. We do not want a partner to sell shares back to the company because he or she has been misled or inadequatelyinformed. Some sellers, however, may disagree with our calculation of value and others may have found investments that they consider more attractive than Berkshire shares. Some of that second group will be right: There are unquestionablymanystocksthatwilldeliverfargreatergainsthanours. In addition, certain shareholders will simply decide it’s time for them or their families to become net consumers rather thancontinuing tobuildcapital. Charlie and Ihavenocurrent interest injoining thatgroup.Perhaps wewillbecomebigspendersinouroldage.   For 54 years our managerial decisions at Berkshire have been made from the viewpoint of the shareholders whoarestaying,notthosewhoareleaving.Consequently,Charlieand Ihaveneverfocusedoncurrent-quarterresults. Berkshire, in fact, may be the only company in the Fortune 500 that does not prepare monthly earnings reports or balance sheets. I, of course, regularly view the monthly financial reports of most subsidiaries. But Charlie and I learnof Berkshire’soverallearningsandfinancialpositiononlyonaquarterlybasis. Furthermore, Berkshire has no company-wide budget (though many of our subsidiaries find one useful). Our lack of such an instrument means that the parent company has never had a quarterly “number” to hit. Shunning the useofthisbogeysendsanimportantmessagetoourmanymanagers,reinforcingthecultureweprize. Over the years, Charlie and I have seen all sorts of bad corporate behavior, both accounting and operational, induced bythedesire ofmanagement tomeet Wall Street expectations.

At Berkshire, our audience is neither analysts nor commentators: Charlie and I are working for our shareholder-partners.Thenumbersthatflowuptouswillbetheoneswesendontoyou. Non-Insurance Operations–From Lollipopsto Locomotives Let’s now look further at Berkshire’s most valuable grove – our collection of non-insurance businesses – keeping in mind that we do not wish to unnecessarily hand our competitors information that might be useful to them. Additionaldetailsaboutindividualoperationscanbefoundonpages K-5–K-22andpages K-40–K-51. Viewed as a group, these businesses earned pre-tax income in 2018 of $20.8 billion, a 24% increase over 2017.Acquisitionswemadein2018deliveredonlyatrivialamountofthatgain. I will stick with pre-tax figures in this discussion. But our after-tax gain in 2018 from these businesses was far greater – 47% – thanks in large part to the cut in the corporate tax rate that became effective at the beginning of thatyear.Let’slookatwhytheimpactwassodramatic. Begin with an economic reality: Like it or not, the U.S. Government “owns” an interest in Berkshire’s earnings of a size determined by Congress. In effect, our country’s Treasury Department holds a special class of our stock – call this holding the AA shares – that receives large “dividends” (that is, tax payments) from Berkshire. In 2017, as in many years before, the corporate tax rate was 35%, which meant that the Treasury was doing very well withits AAshares.Indeed,the Treasury’s“stock,”whichwaspayingnothingwhenwetookoverin1965,hadevolved intoaholdingthatdeliveredbillionsofdollarsannuallytothefederalgovernment. Last year, however, 40% of the government’s “ownership” (14/35ths) was returned to Berkshire – free of charge – when the corporate tax rate was reduced to 21%. Consequently, our “A” and “B” shareholders received a majorboostintheearningsattributabletotheirshares. This happening materially increased the intrinsic value of the Berkshire shares you and I own. The same dynamic,moreover,enhancedtheintrinsicvalueofalmostallofthestocks Berkshireholds. Those are the headlines. But there are other factors to consider that tempered our gain. For example, the tax benefits garnered by our large utility operation get passed along to its customers. Meanwhile, the tax rate applicable tothesubstantialdividendswereceivefromdomesticcorporationsislittlechangedatabout13%.(Thislowerratehas long been logical because our investees have already paid tax on the earnings that they pay to us.) Overall, however, thenewlawmadeourbusinessesandthestocksweownconsiderablymorevaluable.

The remaining non-insurance businesses that Berkshire owns – and there are many – had pre-tax income of $3.6billionin2018vs.$3.3billionin2017. Insurance,“Float,”andthe Fundingof Berkshire Our property/casualty (“P/C”) insurance business – our fifth grove – has been the engine propelling Berkshire’s growth since 1967, the year we acquired National Indemnity and its sister company, National Fire & Marine,for$8.6million.Today,National Indemnityisthelargestproperty/casualtycompanyintheworldasmeasured bynetworth. One reason we were attracted to the P/C business was the industry’s business model: P/C insurers receive premiums upfront and pay claims later. In extreme cases, such as claims arising from exposure to asbestos, or severe workplaceaccidents,paymentscanstretchovermanydecades. This collect-now, pay-later model leaves P/C companies holding large sums – money we call “float” – that will eventually go to others. Meanwhile, insurers get to invest this float for their own benefit. Though individual policies and claims come and go, the amount of float an insurer holds usually remains fairly stable in relation to premium volume. Consequently, as our business grows, so does our float. And how it has grown, as the following tableshows: Year Float(inmillions)* 1970 $ 39 1980 237 1990 1,632 2000 27,871 2010 65,832 2018 122,732 * Includesfloatarisingfromlife,annuityandhealthinsurancebusinesses. We may in time experience a decline in float. If so, the decline will be very gradual –at the outside nomore than 3% in any year. The nature of our insurance contracts is such that wecanneverbesubject toimmediate ornear- term demands for sums that are of significance to our cash resources. That structure is by design and is a key componentintheunequaledfinancialstrengthofourinsurancecompanies.Thatstrengthwillneverbecompromised. If our premiums exceed the total of our expenses and eventual losses, our insurance operation registers an underwriting profit that adds to the investment income the float produces. When such a profit is earned, we enjoy the useoffreemoney–and,betteryet,getpaidforholdingit. Unfortunately, the wish of all insurers to achieve this happy result creates intense competition, so vigorous indeed that it sometimes causes the P/C industry as a whole to operate at a significant underwriting loss.That loss, in effect, is what the industry pays to hold its float. Competitive dynamics almost guarantee that the insurance industry, despite the float income all its companies enjoy, will continue its dismal record of earning subnormal returns on tangiblenetworthascomparedtoother Americanbusinesses. Nevertheless, I like our own prospects. Berkshire’s unrivaled financial strength allows us far more flexibility ininvesting ourfloat thanthatgenerally available to P/Ccompanies. Themanyalternatives availabletousarealways anadvantageandoccasionallyoffermajoropportunities.Whenotherinsurersareconstrained,ourchoicesexpand. Moreover, our P/C companies have an excellent underwriting record. Berkshire has now operated at an underwriting profit for 15 of the past 16 years, the exception being 2017, when our pre-tax loss was $3.2 billion. For theentire16-yearspan,ourpre-taxgaintotaled$27billion,ofwhich$2billionwasrecordedin2018. That record is no accident: Disciplined risk evaluation is the daily focus of our insurance managers, who knowthatthebenefitsoffloatcanbedrownedbypoorunderwritingresults.Allinsurersgivethatmessagelipservice. At Berkshireitisareligion,Old Testamentstyle.   In most cases, the funding of a business comes from two sources – debt and equity. At Berkshire, we have twoadditionalarrowsinthequivertotalkabout,butlet’sfirstaddresstheconventionalcomponents. We use debt sparingly. Many managers, it should be noted, will disagree with this policy, arguing that significantdebtjuicesthereturnsforequityowners.Andthesemoreventuresome CEOswillberightmostofthetime. At rare and unpredictable intervals, however, credit vanishes and debt becomes financially fatal. A Russian- roulette equation – usually win, occasionally die – may make financial sense for someone who gets a piece of a company’s upside but does not share in its downside. But that strategy would be madness for Berkshire. Rational peopledon’triskwhattheyhaveandneedforwhattheydon’thaveanddon’tneed. Most of the debt you see on our consolidated balance sheet – see page K-65 – resides at our railroad and energy subsidiaries, both of them asset-heavy companies.

Had we instead followed a 100% payoutpolicy,wewouldstillbeworkingwiththe$22millionwithwhichwebeganfiscal1965. Beyond using debt and equity, Berkshire has benefitted in a major way from two less-common sources of corporate funding. The larger is the float I have described. So far, those funds, though they are recorded as a huge net liability on our balance sheet, have been of more utility to us than an equivalent amount of equity. That’s because they have usually been accompanied by underwriting earnings. In effect, we have been paid in most years for holding and usingotherpeople’smoney. As I have often done before, I will emphasize that this happy outcome is far from a sure thing: Mistakes in assessing insurance risks can be huge and can take many years to surface. (Think asbestos.) A major catastrophe that will dwarf hurricanes Katrina and Michael will occur – perhaps tomorrow, perhaps many decades from now. “The Big One”maycomefromatraditionalsource,suchasahurricaneorearthquake,oritmaybeatotalsurpriseinvolving, say, a cyber attack having disastrous consequences beyond anything insurers now contemplate. When such a mega- catastrophe strikes, we will get our share of the losses and they will be big – very big. Unlike many other insurers, however,wewillbelookingtoaddbusinessthenextday. The final funding source – which again Berkshire possesses to an unusual degree – is deferred income taxes. Theseareliabilitiesthatwewilleventuallypaybutthataremeanwhileinterest-free. As I indicated earlier, about $14.7 billion of our $50.5 billion of deferred taxes arises from the unrealized gains in our equity holdings. These liabilities are accrued in our financial statements at the current 21% corporate tax rate but will be paid at the rates prevailing when our investments are sold.

Tonyjoined GEICOin1961attheageof18;Imethiminthemid-1970s.Atthattime,GEICO,afterafour- decade record of both rapid growth and outstanding underwriting results, suddenly found itself near bankruptcy. A recently-installed management had grossly underestimated GEICO’s loss costs and consequently underpriced its product. It would take many months until those loss-generating policies on GEICO’s books – there were no less than 2.3millionofthem–wouldexpireandcouldthenberepriced.Thecompany’snetworthinthemeantimewasrapidly approachingzero. In 1976, Jack Byrne was brought in as CEO to rescue GEICO. Soon after his arrival, I met him, concluded thathewastheperfectmanforthejob,andbegantoaggressivelybuy GEICOshares.Withinafewmonths,Berkshire bought about 1⁄ 3 of the company, a portion that later grew to roughly 1⁄ 2 without our spending a dime. That stunning accretion occurred because GEICO, after recovering its health, consistently repurchased its shares. All told, this half- interestin GEICOcost Berkshire$47million,aboutwhatyoumightpaytodayforatrophyapartmentin New York. Let’s now fast-forward 17 years to 1993, when Tony Nicely was promoted to CEO. At that point, GEICO’s reputation and profitability had been restored – but not its growth. Indeed, at yearend 1992 the company had only 1.9 million auto policies on its books, far less than its pre-crisis high. In sales volume among U.S. auto insurers, GEICO thenrankedanundistinguishedseventh. Late in 1995, after Tony had re-energized GEICO, Berkshire made an offer to buythe remaining 50% of the company for $2.3 billion, about 50 times what we had paid for the first half (and people say I never pay up!). Our offer was successful and brought Berkshire a wonderful, but underdeveloped, company and an equally wonderful CEO,whowouldmove GEICOforwardbeyondmydreams. GEICO is now America’s Number Two auto insurer, with sales 1,200% greater than it recorded in 1995. Underwriting profits have totaled $15.5 billion (pre-tax) since our purchase, and float available for investment has grownfrom$2.5billionto$22.1billion. By my estimate, Tony’s management of GEICO has increased Berkshire’s intrinsic value by more than $50 billion.Ontopofthat,heisamodelforeverythingamanagershouldbe,helpinghis40,000associatestoidentifyand polishabilitiestheydidn’trealizetheypossessed. Last year, Tony decided to retire as CEO, and on June 30th he turned that position over to Bill Roberts, his long-time partner.

On its balance sheet, Berkshire carries its Kraft Heinz holding at a GAAP figure of $13.8 billion, an amount reduced by our share of the large write-off of intangible assets taken by Kraft Heinz in 2018.

And, as I will next spell out, the record of American business has been extraordinary. The American Tailwind On March 11th, it will be 77 years since I first invested in an American business.

Let’s now travel back through the two 77-year periods that preceded my purchase. That leaves us starting in 1788, a year prior to George Washington’s installation as our first president. Could anyone then have imagined what theirnewcountrywouldaccomplishinonlythree77-yearlifetimes? During the two 77-year periods prior to 1942, the United States had grown from four million people – about 1⁄ 2 of 1% of the world’s population –intothemost powerfulcountry onearth. Inthatspringof1942,though,itfaced acrisis:The U.S.anditsalliesweresufferingheavylossesinawarthatwehadenteredonlythreemonthsearlier.Bad newsarriveddaily. Despite the alarming headlines, almost all Americans believed on that March 11th that the war would be won. Nor was their optimism limited to that victory. Leaving aside congenital pessimists, Americans believed that theirchildrenandgenerationsbeyondwouldlivefarbetterlivesthantheythemselveshadled. The nation’s citizens understood, of course, that the road ahead would not be a smooth ride.

Nevertheless, in 1942, when I made my purchase, the nation expected post-war growth, a belief that proved tobewell-founded.Infact,thenation’sachievementscanbestbedescribedasbreathtaking. Let’s put numbers to that claim: If my $114.75 had been invested in a no-fee S&P 500 index fund, and all dividendshadbeenreinvested,mystakewouldhavegrowntobeworth(pre-taxes)$606,811on January31,2019(the latestdataavailablebeforetheprintingofthisletter).Thatisagainof5,288for1.Meanwhile,a$1millioninvestment by a tax-free institution of that time – say, a pension fund or college endowment – would have grown to about $5.3 billion. Let me add one additional calculation that I believe will shock you: If that hypothetical institution had paid only 1% of assets annually to various “helpers,” such as investment managers and consultants, its gain would have been cut in half, to $2.65 billion. That’s what happens over 77 years when the 11.8% annual return actually achieved bythe S&P500isrecalculatedata10.8%rate.

Remember, earlier in this letter, how I described retained earnings as having been the key to Berkshire’s prosperity? So it has been with America. In the nation’s accounting, the comparable item is labeled “savings.” And save we have. If our forefathers had instead consumed all they produced, there would have been no investment, no productivitygainsandnoleapinlivingstandards.   Charlie and I happily acknowledge that much of Berkshire’s success has simply been a product of what I thinkshouldbecalled The American Tailwind.Itisbeyondarrogance for American businesses orindividuals toboast that they have “done it alone.” The tidy rows of simple white crosses at Normandy should shame those who make suchclaims. Therearealsomanyothercountries aroundtheworldthat havebright futures. Aboutthat,weshouldrejoice: Americans will be both more prosperous and safer if all nations thrive. At Berkshire, we hope to invest significant sumsacrossborders. Over the next 77 years, however, the major source of our gains will almost certainly be provided by The American Tailwind.Wearelucky–gloriouslylucky–tohavethatforceatourback.
