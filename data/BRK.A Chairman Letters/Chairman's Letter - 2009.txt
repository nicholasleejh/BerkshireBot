How We Measure Ourselves Our metrics for evaluating our managerial performance are displayed on the facing page. From the start, Charlie and I have believed in having a rational and unbending standard for measuring what we have – or have not–accomplished.Thatkeepsusfromthetemptationofseeingwherethearrowofperformancelandsandthen paintingthebull’seyearoundit. Selecting the S&P 500 as our bogey was an easy choice because our shareholders, at virtually no cost, can matchitsperformancebyholdinganindexfund.Whyshouldtheypayusformerelyduplicatingthatresult? A more difficult decision for us was how to measure the progress of Berkshire versus the S&P. There are good arguments for simply using the change in our stock price. Over an extended period of time, in fact, that is thebesttest.Butyear-to-yearmarketpricescanbeextraordinarilyerratic.Evenevaluationscoveringaslongasa decade can be greatly distorted by foolishly high or low prices at the beginning or end of the measurement period.Steve Ballmer,of Microsoft,and Jeff Immelt,of GE,cantellyouaboutthatproblem,sufferingastheydo fromthenosebleedpricesatwhichtheirstockstradedwhentheywerehandedthemanagerialbaton. Theidealstandardformeasuringouryearlyprogresswouldbethechangein Berkshire’sper-shareintrinsic value.Alas,thatvaluecannotbecalculatedwithanythingclosetoprecision,soweinsteaduseacrudeproxyfor it: per-share book value. Relying on this yardstick has its shortcomings, which we discuss on pages 92 and 93. Additionally, book value at most companies understates intrinsic value, and that is certainly the case at Berkshire.Inaggregate,ourbusinessesareworthconsiderablymorethanthevaluesatwhichtheyarecarriedon our books. In our all-important insurance business, moreover, the difference is huge. Even so, Charlie and I believe that our book value – understated though it is – supplies the most useful tracking device for changes in intrinsicvalue.Bythismeasurement,astheopeningparagraphofthisletterstates,ourbookvaluesincethestart offiscal1965hasgrownatarateof20.3%compoundedannually. *All per-share figures used in this report apply to Berkshire’s A shares. Figures for the B shares are 1/1500thofthoseshownfor A. We should note that had we instead chosen market prices as our yardstick, Berkshire’s results would lookbetter,showingagainsincethestartoffiscal1965of22%compoundedannually.Surprisingly,thismodest difference in annual compounding rate leads to an 801,516% market-value gain for the entire 45-year period compared to the book-value gain of 434,057% (shown on page 2). Our market gain is better because in 1965 Berkshire shares sold at an appropriate discount to the book value of its underearning textile assets, whereas today Berkshiresharesregularlysellatapremiumtotheaccountingvaluesofitsfirst-classbusinesses. Summed up, the table on page 2 conveys three messages, two positive and one hugely negative. First, wehaveneverhadanyfive-yearperiodbeginningwith1965-69andendingwith2005-09–andtherehavebeen 41ofthese–duringwhichourgaininbookvaluedidnotexceedthe S&P’sgain.Second,thoughwehavelagged the S&P in some years that were positive for the market, we have consistently done better than the S&P in the eleven years during which it delivered negative results. In other words, our defense has been better than our offense,andthat’slikelytocontinue.

What We Don’t Do Longago,Charlielaidouthisstrongestambition:“All Iwanttoknowiswhere I’mgoingtodie,so I’ll never go there.” That bit of wisdom was inspired by Jacobi, the great Prussian mathematician, who counseled “Invert, always invert” as an aid to solving difficult problems. (I can report as well that this inversion approach works on a less lofty level: Sing a country song in reverse, and you will quickly recover your car, house and wife.) Hereareafewexamplesofhowweapply Charlie’sthinkingat Berkshire: • Charlie and I avoid businesses whose futures we can’t evaluate, no matter how exciting their products may be. In the past, it required no brilliance for people to foresee the fabulous growth thatawaitedsuchindustriesasautos(in1910),aircraft(in1930)andtelevisionsets(in1950).But the future then also included competitive dynamics that would decimate almost all of the companiesenteringthoseindustries.Eventhesurvivorstendedtocomeawaybleeding. Just because Charlie and I can clearly see dramatic growth ahead for an industry does not mean wecanjudgewhatits profit margins andreturns oncapital willbeasahostofcompetitors battle for supremacy. At Berkshire we will stick with businesses whose profit picture for decades to comeseemsreasonablypredictable.Eventhen,wewillmakeplentyofmistakes. • We will never become dependent on the kindness of strangers. Too-big-to-fail is not a fallback positionat Berkshire.Instead,wewillalwaysarrangeouraffairssothatanyrequirementsforcash we may conceivably have will be dwarfed by our own liquidity. Moreover, that liquidity will be constantlyrefreshedbyagusherofearningsfromourmanyanddiversebusinesses. When the financial system went into cardiac arrest in September 2008, Berkshire was a supplier of liquidity and capital to the system, not a supplicant. At the very peak of the crisis, we poured $15.5 billion into a business world that could otherwise look only to the federal government for help. Of that, $9 billion went to bolster capital at three highly-regarded and previously-secure Americanbusinessesthatneeded–withoutdelay–ourtangiblevoteofconfidence.Theremaining $6.5 billion satisfied our commitment to help fund the purchase of Wrigley, a deal that was completedwithoutpausewhile,elsewhere,panicreigned. We pay a steep price to maintain our premier financial strength. The $20 billion-plus of cash- equivalentassetsthatwecustomarilyholdisearningapittanceatpresent.Butwesleepwell. • We tend to let our many subsidiaries operate on their own, without our supervising and monitoring them to any degree. That means we are sometimes late in spotting management problems and that both operating and capital decisions are occasionally made with which Charlie and I would have disagreed had we been consulted. Most of our managers, however, use the independence we grant them magnificently, rewarding our confidence by maintaining an owner- oriented attitude that is invaluable and too seldom found in huge organizations. We would rather suffer the visible costs of a few bad decisions than incur the many invisible coststhatcomefrom decisionsmadetooslowly–ornotatall–becauseofastiflingbureaucracy. With our acquisition of BNSF, we now have about 257,000 employees and literally hundreds of differentoperatingunits.Wehopetohavemanymoreofeach.Butwewillneverallow Berkshire to become some monolith that is overrun with committees, budget presentations and multiple layersofmanagement.Instead,weplantooperateasacollectionofseparately-managedmedium- sized and large businesses, most of whose decision-making occurs at the operating level. Charlie and I will limit ourselves to allocating capital, controlling enterprise risk, choosing managers and settingtheircompensation. • Wemakenoattempttowoo Wall Street.Investorswhobuyandsellbaseduponmediaoranalyst commentary are not for us. Instead wewant partners whojoin us at Berkshire because they wish tomakealong-terminvestmentinabusinesstheythemselvesunderstandandbecauseit’sonethat follows policies with which they concur.

To build a compatible shareholder population, we try to communicate with our owners directly and informatively. Our goal is to tell you what we would like to know if our positions were reversed. Additionally, we try to post our quarterly and annual financial information on the Internet early on weekends, thereby giving you and other investors plenty of time during a non-tradingperiodtodigestjustwhathashappenedatourmulti-facetedenterprise.(Occasionally, SEC deadlines force a non-Friday disclosure.) These matters simply can’t be adequately summarized in a few paragraphs, nor do they lend themselves to the kind of catchy headline that journalistssometimesseek. Last year we saw, in one instance, how sound-bite reporting can go wrong. Among the 12,830 words in the annual letter was this sentence: “We are certain, for example, that the economy will beinshamblesthroughout2009–andprobablywellbeyond–butthatconclusiondoesnottellus whetherthemarketwillriseorfall.”Manynewsorganizationsreported–indeed,blared–thefirst part of the sentence while making no mention whatsoever of its ending. I regard this as terrible journalism: Misinformed readers or viewers may well have thought that Charlie and I were forecasting bad things for the stock market, though we had not only in that sentence, but also elsewhere, made it clear we weren’t predicting the market at all. Any investors who were misled bythe sensationalists paid a big price: The Dowclosedthedayoftheletter at7,063andfinished theyearat10,428. Given a few experiences we’ve had like that, you can understand why I prefer that our communicationswithyouremainasdirectandunabridgedaspossible.   Let’s move to the specifics of Berkshire’s operations. We have four major operating sectors, each differingfromtheothersinbalancesheetandincomeaccountcharacteristics. Therefore,lumpingthemtogether, asisstandardinfinancialstatements,impedesanalysis.Sowe’llpresentthemasfourseparatebusinesses,which ishow Charlieand Iviewthem. Insurance Ourproperty-casualty(P/C)insurancebusinesshasbeentheenginebehind Berkshire’sgrowthandwill continue to be. It has worked wonders for us. We carry our P/C companies on our books at $15.5 billion more than their net tangible assets, an amount lodged in our “Goodwill” account. These companies, however, are worthfarmorethantheircarryingvalue–andthefollowinglookattheeconomicmodelofthe P/Cindustrywill tellyouwhy. Insurers receive premiums upfront and pay claims later. In extreme cases, such as those arising from certain workers’ compensation accidents, payments can stretch over decades. This collect-now, pay-later model leaves us holding large sums – money we call “float” – that will eventually go to others. Meanwhile, we get to invest thisfloat for Berkshire’s benefit. Thoughindividualpoliciesandclaimscomeandgo,theamountoffloat weholdremainsremarkablystableinrelationtopremiumvolume.Consequently,asourbusinessgrows,sodoes ourfloat. If premiums exceed the total of expenses and eventual losses, we register an underwriting profit that adds to the investment income produced from the float. This combination allows us to enjoy the use of free money – and, better yet, get paid for holding it. Alas, the hope of this happy result attracts intense competition, so vigorous in most years as to cause the P/C industry as a whole to operate at a significant underwriting loss. This loss, in effect, is what the industry pays to hold its float. Usually this cost is fairly low, but in some catastrophe-ridden years the cost from underwriting losses more than eats up the income derived from use of float. In my perhaps biased view, Berkshire has the best large insurance operation in the world. And I will absolutelystatethatwehavethebestmanagers.Ourfloathasgrownfrom$16millionin1967,whenweentered the business, to $62 billion at the end of 2009. Moreover, we have now operated at an underwriting profit for seven consecutive years. I believe it likely that we will continue to underwrite profitably in most – though certainlynotall–futureyears.Ifwedoso,ourfloatwillbecost-free,muchasifsomeonedeposited$62billion withusthatwecouldinvestforourownbenefitwithoutthepaymentofinterest. Let me emphasize again that cost-free float is not a result to be expected for the P/C industry as a whole: In most years, premiums have been inadequate to cover claims plus expenses. Consequently, the industry’s overall return on tangible equity has for many decades fallen far short of that achieved by the S&P 500. Outstanding economics exist at Berkshire only because we have some outstanding managers running some unusual businesses. Our insurance CEOs deserve your thanks, having added many billions of dollars to Berkshire’svalue.It’sapleasureformetotellyouabouttheseall-stars.   Let’s start at GEICO, which is known to all of you because of its $800 million annual advertising budget (close to twice that of the runner-up advertiser in the auto insurance field). GEICO is managed by Tony Nicely, who joined the company at 18.Now66,Tonystill tap-dances to the office every day, just as I doat 79. Webothfeelluckytoworkatabusinesswelove. GEICO’s customers have warm feelings toward the company as well. Here’s proof: Since Berkshire acquired control of GEICOin 1996, its market share has increased from 2.5% to 8.1%, a gain reflecting the net additionofsevenmillionpolicyholders.Perhapstheycontactedusbecausetheythoughtourgeckowascute,but they bought from us to save important money.

Our “low-cost producer” status, however, is sure to give us significant gains in the future. In 1995, GEICO was the country’s sixth largest auto insurer; now we are number three. The company’s float has grown from $2.7 billion to $9.6 billion. Equally important,GEICOhasoperatedatanunderwritingprofitin13ofthe14years Berkshirehasownedit. I became excited about GEICO in January 1951, when I first visited the company as a 20-year-old student.Thanksto Tony,I’mevenmoreexcitedtoday.   A hugely important event in Berkshire’s history occurred on a Saturday in 1985. Ajit Jain came into our office in Omaha – and I immediately knew we had found a superstar.

Moreover, we continue to pour huge sums of money into our operations so as to not only prepare for the future but also make these operations more environmentally friendly. Since we purchased Mid American ten years ago, it has never paid a dividend. We have instead used earnings to improve and expand our properties in each of the territories we serve. As one dramatic example, in the last three years our Iowa and Western utilities haveearned$2.5billion,whileinthissameperiodspending$3billiononwindgenerationfacilities.

We believe that, in turn, we will be allowed the return we deserve on the funds we invest. In earlier days, Charlie and I shunned capital-intensive businesses such as public utilities. Indeed, the best businesses by far for owners continue to be those that have high returns on capital and that require little incrementalinvestmenttogrow.Wearefortunatetoownanumberofsuchbusinesses,andwewouldlovetobuy more. Anticipating, however, that Berkshire will generate ever-increasing amounts of cash, we are today quite willingtoenterbusinessesthatregularlyrequirelargecapitalexpenditures.Weexpectonlythatthesebusinesses have reasonable expectations of earning decent returns on the incremental sums they invest. If our expectations are met – and we believe that they will be – Berkshire’s ever-growing collection of good to great businesses shouldproduceabove-average,thoughcertainlynotspectacular,returnsinthedecadesahead. Our BNSF operation, it should be noted, has certain important economic characteristics that resemble thoseofourelectricutilities.Inbothcasesweprovidefundamentalservicesthatare,andwillremain,essentialto the economic well-being of our customers, the communities we serve, and indeed the nation. Both will require heavy investment that greatly exceeds depreciation allowances for decades to come. Both must also plan far ahead to satisfy demand that is expected to outstrip the needs of the past. Finally, both require wise regulators who will provide certainty about allowable returns so that we can confidently make the huge investments requiredtomaintain,replaceandexpandtheplant. We see a “social compact” existing between the public and our railroad business, just as is the case with our utilities. If either side shirks its obligations, both sides will inevitably suffer. Therefore, both parties to the compact should – and we believe will – understand the benefit of behaving in a way that encourages good behavior by the other. It is inconceivable that our country will realize anything close to its full economic potential without its possessing first-class electricity and railroad systems. We will do our part to see that they exist. In the future, BNSF results will be included in this “regulated utility” section. Aside from the two businesses having similar underlying economic characteristics, both are logical users of substantial amounts of debt that is not guaranteed by Berkshire. Both will retain most of their earnings. Bothwill earn and invest large sums in good times or bad, though the railroad will display the greater cyclicality.

Frank Ptak’s Marmon delivered a 13.5% pre-tax profit margin, a record high. Though the company’s sales were down27%, Frank’s cost-conscious management mitigatedthedeclineinearnings. Nothing stops Israel-based Iscar – not wars, recessions or competitors. The world’s two other leading suppliers of small cutting tools both had very difficult years, each operating at a loss throughout much of the year. Though Iscar’s results were down significantly from 2008, the company regularly reported profits, even while it was integrating and rationalizing Tungaloy, the large Japanese acquisition that we told you about last year. When manufacturing rebounds, Iscar will set new records. Its incredible managerial team of Eitan Wertheimer,Jacob Harpazand Danny Goldmanwillseetothat. Every business we own that is connected to residential and commercial construction suffered severely in 2009. Combined pre-tax earnings of Shaw, Johns Manville, Acme Brick, and Mi Tek were $227 million, an 82.5% decline from $1.295billion in 2006,whenconstruction activity wasbooming.

Financeand Financial Products Our largest operation in this sector is Clayton Homes, the country’s leading producer of modular and manufactured homes. Clayton was not always number one: A decade ago the three leading manufacturers were Fleetwood, Champion and Oakwood, which together accounted for 44% of the output of the industry. All have since gone bankrupt. Total industry output, meanwhile, has fallen from 382,000units in 1999to 60,000units in 2009. Theindustry isinshambles fortworeasons, thefirst ofwhichmustbelivedwithifthe U.S.economy istorecover.Thisreasonconcerns U.S.housingstarts(includingapartmentunits).In2009,startswere554,000, byfarthelowestnumberinthe50yearsforwhichwehavedata.Paradoxically,thisisgoodnews. Peoplethoughtitwasgoodnewsafewyearsbackwhenhousingstarts–thesupplysideofthepicture – were running about two million annually. But household formations – the demand side – only amounted to about 1.2 million. After a few years of such imbalances, the country unsurprisingly ended up with far too many houses. There were three ways to cure this overhang: (1) blow up a lot of houses, a tactic similar to the destruction of autos that occurred with the “cash-for-clunkers” program; (2) speed up household formations by, say, encouraging teenagers to cohabitate, a program not likely to suffer from a lack of volunteers or; (3) reduce newhousingstartstoanumberfarbelowtherateofhouseholdformations. Our country has wisely selected the third option, which means that within a year or so residential housing problems should largely be behind us, the exceptions being only high-value houses and those in certain localitieswhereoverbuildingwasparticularlyegregious.Priceswillremainfarbelow“bubble”levels,ofcourse, butforeveryseller(orlender)hurtbythistherewillbeabuyerwhobenefits.Indeed,manyfamiliesthatcouldn’t affordtobuyanappropriatehomeafewyearsagonowfinditwellwithintheirmeansbecausethebubbleburst. The second reason that manufactured housing is troubled is specific to the industry: the punitive differential in mortgage rates between factory-built homes and site-built homes. Before you read further, let me underscore the obvious: Berkshire has a dog in this fight, and you should therefore assess the commentary that followswithspecialcare.Thatwarningmade,however,letmeexplainwhytheratedifferentialcausesproblems forbothlargenumbersoflower-income Americansand Clayton. The residential mortgage market is shaped by government rules that are expressed by FHA, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. Their lending standards are all-powerful because the mortgages they insure can typically be securitized and turned into what, in effect, is an obligation of the U.S. government. Currently buyers of conventional site-built homes who qualify for these guarantees can obtain a 30-year loan at about 51⁄ 4%. In addition, these are mortgages that have recently been purchased in massive amounts by the Federal Reserve, an actionthatalsohelpedtokeepratesatbargain-basementlevels. In contrast, very few factory-built homes qualify for agency-insured mortgages. Therefore, a meritorious buyer of a factory-built home must pay about 9% on his loan. For the all-cash buyer, Clayton’s homesofferterrificvalue.Ifthebuyerneedsmortgagefinancing,however–and,ofcourse,mostbuyersdo–the differenceinfinancingcoststoooftennegatestheattractivepriceofafactory-builthome. Lastyear Itoldyouwhyourbuyers–generallypeoplewithlowincomes–performedsowellascredit risks. Their attitude was all-important: They signed up to live in the home, not resell or refinance it. Consequently, our buyers usually took out loans with payments geared to their verified incomes (we weren’t making “liar’s loans”) and looked forward to the day they could burn their mortgage. If they lost their jobs,had health problems or got divorced, we could of course expect defaults. But they seldom walked away simply because house values had fallen. Even today, though job-loss troubles have grown, Clayton’s delinquencies and defaultsremainreasonableandwillnotcauseussignificantproblems. We have tried to qualify more of our customers’ loans for treatment similar to those available on the site-built product. So far we have had only token success. Many families with modest incomes but responsible habits have therefore had to forego home ownership simply because the financing differential attached to the factory-built product makes monthly payments too expensive. If qualifications aren’t broadened, so as to open low-costfinancingtoallwhomeetdown-paymentandincomestandards,themanufactured-homeindustryseems destinedtostruggleanddwindle. Even under these conditions, I believe Clayton will operate profitably in coming years, though well belowitspotential.Wecouldn’thaveabettermanagerthan CEOKevin Clayton,whotreats Berkshire’sinterests asiftheywerehisown.Ourproductisfirst-class,inexpensiveandconstantlybeingimproved.Moreover,wewill continuetouse Berkshire’scredittosupport Clayton’smortgageprogram,convincedasweareofitssoundness.

Offsetting this cost to Clayton is an identical amount of income credited to Berkshire’s finance operation and included in “Other Income.” The cost and income amount was $116 million in 2009 and $92 millionin2008. The table also illustrates how severely our furniture (CORT) and trailer (XTRA) leasing operations have been hit by the recession.

At the end of 2009, we became a 50% owner of Berkadia Commercial Mortgage (formerly known as Capmark), the country’s third-largest servicer of commercial mortgages. In addition to servicing a $235 billion portfolio, the company is an important originator of mortgages, having 25 offices spread around the country. Though commercial real estate will face major problems in the next few years, long-term opportunities for Berkadiaaresignificant. Ourpartnerinthisoperationis Leucadia,runby Joe Steinbergand Ian Cumming,withwhomwehada terrific experience some years back when Berkshire joined with them to purchase Finova, a troubled finance business.

Last year I wrote extensively about our derivatives contracts, which were then the subject of both controversyandmisunderstanding.Forthatdiscussion,pleasegotowww.berkshirehathaway.com. We have since changed only a few of our positions. Some credit contracts have run off. The terms of about 10% of our equity put contracts have also changed: Maturities have been shortened and strike prices materiallyreduced.Inthesemodifications,nomoneychangedhands. Afewpointsfromlastyear’sdiscussionareworthrepeating: (1) Though it’s no sure thing, I expect our contracts in aggregate to deliver us a profit over their lifetime, even when investment income on the huge amount of float they provide us is excluded in the calculation. Our derivatives float – which is not included in the $62 billion of insurance float I describedearlier–wasabout$6.3billionatyearend. (2) Onlyahandfulofourcontractsrequireustopostcollateralunderanycircumstances.Atlastyear’slow point in the stock and credit markets, our posting requirement was $1.7 billion, a small fraction of the derivatives-related float we held. When we do post collateral, let me add, the securities we put up continuetoearnmoneyforouraccount. (3) Finally, you should expect large swings in the carrying value of these contracts, items that can affect our reported quarterly earnings in a huge way but that do not affect our cash or investment holdings. That thought certainly fit 2009’s circumstances. Here are the pre-tax quarterly gains and losses from derivativesvaluationsthatwerepartofourreportedearningslastyear: Quarter $Gain(Loss)in Billions 1 (1.517) 2 2.357 3 1.732 4 1.052 As we’ve explained, these wild swings neither cheer nor bother Charlie and me. When we report to you,wewillcontinuetoseparateoutthesefigures(aswedorealizedinvestmentgainsandlosses)sothatyoucan more clearly view the earnings of our operating businesses. We are delighted that we hold the derivatives contracts that we do. To date we have significantly profited from the float they provide. We expect also to earn furtherinvestmentincomeoverthelifeofourcontracts. We have long invested inderivatives contracts that Charlie and Ithinkaremispriced, justaswetryto invest in mispriced stocks andbonds.Indeed,wefirst reported toyouthat weheldsuchcontracts inearly 1998. The dangers that derivatives pose for both participants and society – dangers of which we’ve long warned, and that can be dynamite – arise when these contracts lead to leverage and/or counterparty risk that is extreme. At Berkshirenothinglikethathasoccurred–norwillit. It’smyjobtokeep Berkshirefarawayfromsuchproblems.Charlieand Ibelievethata CEOmustnot delegate risk control. It’s simply too important. At Berkshire, I both initiate and monitor every derivatives contract on our books, with the exception of operations-related contracts at a few of our subsidiaries, such as Mid American,andtheminorrunoffcontractsat General Re.If Berkshireevergetsintrouble,itwillbemyfault. Itwillnotbebecauseofmisjudgmentsmadebya Risk Committeeor Chief Risk Officer.   In my view a board of directors of a huge financial institution is derelict if it does not insist that its CEO bear full responsibility for risk control. If he’s incapable of handling that job, he should look for other employment.Andifhefailsatit–withthegovernmentthereuponrequiredtostepinwithfundsorguarantees– thefinancialconsequencesforhimandhisboardshouldbesevere.

It is the behavior of these CEOs and directors that needs to be changed: If their institutions and the country are harmed by their recklessness, they should pay a heavy price – one not reimbursable by the companies they’ve damaged nor by insurance. CEOs and, in many cases, directors have long benefitted from oversized financial carrots; some meaningfulsticksnowneedtobepartoftheiremploymentpictureaswell. An Inconvenient Truth(Boardroom Overheating) Our subsidiaries made a few small “bolt-on” acquisitions last year for cash, but our blockbuster deal with BNSF required us to issue about 95,000 Berkshire shares that amounted to 6.1% of those previously outstanding.Charlieand Ienjoyissuing Berkshirestockaboutasmuchaswerelishpreppingforacolonoscopy.

That’s why bubbles in various areas of the stock market have invariably led to serial issuances of stockbyslypromoters.Goingbythemarketvalueoftheirstock,theycanaffordtooverpaybecausetheyare,in effect, using counterfeit money. Periodically, many air-for-assets acquisitions have taken place, the late 1960s having been a particularly obscene period for such chicanery. Indeed, certain large companies were built in this way. (No one involved, of course, ever publicly acknowledges the reality of what is going on, though there is plentyofprivatesnickering.) Inour BNSFacquisition, theselling shareholders quiteproperly evaluated ouroffer at$100pershare.

In the end, Charlie and I decided that the disadvantage of paying 30% of the price through stock was offset by the opportunity the acquisition gave us to deploy $22 billion of cash in a business we understood and liked for the long term. It has the additional virtue of being run by Matt Rose, whom we trust and admire. We also like the prospect of investing additional billions over the years at reasonable rates of return. But the final decisionwasacloseone.Ifwehadneededtousemorestocktomaketheacquisition,itwouldinfacthavemade nosense.Wewouldhavethenbeengivingupmorethanweweregetting.   I have been in dozens of board meetings in which acquisitions have been deliberated, often with the directors being instructed byhigh-priced investment bankers (are there any other kind?).Invariably, thebankers give the board a detailed assessment of the value of the company being purchased, with emphasis on why it is worthfarmorethanitsmarketprice.Inmorethanfiftyyearsofboardmemberships,however,neverhave Iheard theinvestmentbankers(ormanagement!)discussthetruevalueofwhatisbeinggiven.Whenadealinvolvedthe issuance of the acquirer’s stock, they simply used market value to measure the cost.

We owned stock in a large well-run bank that for decades had been statutorily prevented from acquisitions. Eventually, the law was changed and our bank immediately began looking for possible purchases. Its managers – fine people and able bankers – not unexpectedlybegantobehaveliketeenageboyswhohadjustdiscoveredgirls. They soon focused on a much smaller bank, also well-run and having similar financial characteristics in such areas as return on equity, interest margin, loan quality, etc. Our bank sold at a modest price (that’s why we had bought into it), hovering near book value and possessing a very low price/earnings ratio.

The first will be a cocktail reception from6p.m.to10p.m.on Friday,April30th.Thesecond,themaingala,willbeheldon Sunday,May2nd,from9 a.m.to4p.m.On Saturday,wewillbeopenuntil6p.m. We will have huge crowds at Borsheims throughout the weekend. For your convenience, therefore, shareholder prices will be available from Monday, April 26th through Saturday, May 8th. During that period, please identify yourself as a shareholder by presenting your meeting credentials or a brokerage statement that shows you are a Berkshire holder. Enter with rhinestones; leave with diamonds. My daughter tells me that the moreyoubuy,themoreyousave(kidssaythedarnedestthings). On Sunday,inthemalloutsideof Borsheims,ablindfolded Patrick Wolff,twice U.S.chesschampion, will take on all comers – who will have their eyes wide open – in groups of six. Nearby, Norman Beck, a remarkablemagicianfrom Dallas,willbewilderonlookers. Our special treat for shareholders this year will be the return of my friend, Ariel Hsing, the country’s top-ranked junior table tennis player (and a good bet to win at the Olympics some day). Now 14, Ariel came to the annual meeting four years ago and demolished all comers, including me. (You can witness my humiliating defeaton You Tube;justtypein Ariel Hsing Berkshire.) Naturally, I’ve been plotting a comeback and will take her on outside of Borsheims at 1:00 p.m. on Sunday. It will be a three-point match, and after I soften her up, all shareholders are invited to try their luck at similar three-point contests. Winners willbegivenaboxof See’scandy.Wewillhaveequipmentavailable, but bringyourownpaddleifyouthinkitwillhelp.(Itwon’t.) Gorat’s will again be open exclusively for Berkshire shareholders on Sunday, May 2nd, and will be serving from 1 p.m. until 10 p.m. Last year, though, it was overwhelmed by demand. With many more diners expected this year, I’ve asked myfriend, Donna Sheehan,at Piccolo’s –another favorite restaurant ofmine–to serve shareholders on Sundayas well. (Piccolo’s giantrootbeerfloat ismandatory foranyfanoffinedining.) I plan to eat at both restaurants: All of the weekend action makes me really hungry, and I have favorite dishes at each spot. Remember: To make a reservation at Gorat’s, call 402-551-3733 on April 1st (but not before) and at Piccolo’scall402-342-9038. Regrettably,wewillnotbeabletohaveareceptionforinternationalvisitorsthisyear.Ourcountgrew to about 800 last year, and my simply signing one item per person took about 21⁄ 2 hours. Since we expect even more international visitors this year, Charlie and I decided we must drop this function. But be assured, we welcomeeveryinternationalvisitorwhocomes. Last year we changed our method of determining what questions would be asked at the meeting and received many dozens of letters applauding the new arrangement. We will therefore again have the same three financialjournalistsleadthequestion-and-answerperiod,asking Charlieandmequestionsthatshareholdershave submittedtothembye-mail. The journalists and their e-mail addresses are: Carol Loomis, of Fortune, who may be e-mailed at cloomis@fortunemail.com; Becky Quick, of CNBC, at Berkshire Questions@cnbc.com, and Andrew Ross Sorkin, of The New York Times, at arsorkin@nytimes.com. From the questions submitted, each journalist will choose the dozen or so he or she decides are the most interesting and important. The journalists have told me yourquestionhasthebestchanceofbeingselectedifyoukeepitconciseandincludenomorethantwoquestions in any e-mail you send them. (In your e-mail, let the journalist know if you would like your name mentioned if yourquestionisselected.) Neither Charlie nor I will get so much as a clue about the questions to be asked. We know the journalistswillpicksometoughonesandthat’sthewaywelikeit. We will again have a drawing at 8:15 on Saturday at each of 13 microphones for those shareholders wishing to ask questions themselves. At the meeting, I will alternate the questions asked by the journalists with those from the winning shareholders. We’ve added 30 minutes tothequestion time andwillprobablyhavetime forabout30questionsfromeachgroup.   At 86 and 79, Charlie and I remain lucky beyond our dreams. We were born in America; had terrific parents who saw that we got good educations; have enjoyed wonderful families and great health; and came equipped with a “business” gene that allows us to prosper in a manner hugely disproportionate to that experienced by many people who contribute as much or more to our society’s well-being. Moreover, we have longhadjobsthatwelove,inwhichwearehelpedincountlesswaysbytalentedandcheerfulassociates.Indeed, over the years, our work has become ever more fascinating; no wonder we tap-dance to work.
