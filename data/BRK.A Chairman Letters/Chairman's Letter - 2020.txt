BERKSHIREHATHAWAYINC. Tothe Shareholdersof Berkshire Hathaway Inc.: Berkshire earned $42.5 billion in 2020 according to generally accepted accounting principles (commonly called “GAAP”). The four components of that figure are $21.9 billion of operating earnings, $4.9 billion of realized capitalgains,a$26.7billiongainfromanincreaseintheamountofnetunrealizedcapitalgainsthatexistinthestocks we hold and, finally, an $11 billion loss from a write-down in the value of a few subsidiary and affiliate businesses thatweown.Allitemsarestatedonanafter-taxbasis. Operatingearningsarewhatcountmost,evenduringperiodswhentheyarenotthelargestiteminour GAAP total.Ourfocusat Berkshireisbothtoincreasethissegmentofourincomeandtoacquirelargeandfavorably-situated businesses. Last year, however, we met neither goal: Berkshire made no sizable acquisitions and operating earnings fell 9%. We did, though, increase Berkshire’s per-share intrinsic value by both retaining earnings and repurchasing about5%ofourshares. Thetwo GAAPcomponents pertaining tocapital gainsorlosses (whether realized orunrealized) fluctuate capriciouslyfromyeartoyear,reflectingswingsinthestockmarket.Whatevertoday’sfigures,Charlie Munger,my long-timepartner,and Ifirmlybelievethat,overtime,Berkshire’scapitalgainsfromitsinvestmentholdingswillbe substantial. As I’veemphasizedmanytimes,Charlieand Iview Berkshire’sholdingsofmarketablestocks–atyearend worth $281 billion – as a collection of businesses. We don’t control the operations of those companies, but we do share proportionately in their long-term prosperity. From an accounting standpoint, however, our portion of their earningsisnotincludedin Berkshire’sincome.Instead,onlywhattheseinvesteespayusindividendsisrecordedon ourbooks.Under GAAP,thehugesumsthatinvesteesretainonourbehalfbecomeinvisible. What’s out of sight, however, should not be out of mind: Those unrecorded retained earnings are usually building value – lots of value – for Berkshire. Investees use the withheld funds to expand their business, make acquisitions,payoffdebtand,often,torepurchasetheirstock(anactthatincreasesourshareoftheirfutureearnings). As we pointed out in these pages last year, retained earnings have propelled American business throughout our country’s history. What worked for Carnegie and Rockefeller has, over the years, worked its magic for millions of shareholdersaswell. Ofcourse,someofourinvesteeswilldisappoint,addinglittle,ifanything,tothevalueoftheircompanyby retaining earnings. But others will over-deliver, a few spectacularly. In aggregate, we expect our share of the huge pile of earnings retained by Berkshire’s non-controlled businesses (whatothers wouldlabel ourequityportfolio) to eventuallydeliverusanequalorgreateramountofcapitalgains.Overour56-yeartenure,thatexpectationhasbeen met. The final component in our GAAP figure – that ugly $11 billion write-down – is almost entirely the quantification ofamistake Imadein2016.Thatyear,Berkshirepurchased Precision Castparts(“PCC”),and Ipaid toomuchforthecompany.

Two Stringsto Our Bow Berkshire is often labeled a conglomerate, a negative term applied to holding companies that own a hodge-podge of unrelated businesses. And,yes,thatdescribes Berkshire –butonlyinpart.Tounderstand howand whywedifferfromtheprototypeconglomerate,let’sreviewalittlehistory. Over time, conglomerates have generally limited themselves to buying businesses in their entirety. That strategy, however, came with two major problems. One was unsolvable: Most of the truly great businesses had no interest in having anyone take them over. Consequently, deal-hungry conglomerateurs had to focus on so-so companiesthatlackedimportantanddurablecompetitivestrengths.Thatwasnotagreatpondinwhichtofish. Beyond that, as conglomerateurs dipped into this universe of mediocre businesses, they often found themselvesrequiredtopaystaggering“control”premiumstosnaretheirquarry.Aspiringconglomerateursknewthe answer to this “overpayment” problem: Theysimply needed to manufacture a vastly overvalued stockoftheir own thatcouldbeusedasa“currency”forpriceyacquisitions.(“I’llpayyou$10,000foryourdogbygivingyoutwoof my$5,000cats.”) Often, the tools for fostering the overvaluation of a conglomerate’s stock involved promotional techniques and“imaginative” accountingmaneuvers that were,at best,deceptive and that sometimes crossedthe line intofraud. Whenthesetrickswere“successful,”theconglomeratepusheditsownstockto,say,3xitsbusinessvalueinorderto offerthetarget2xitsvalue. Investing illusions can continue for a surprisingly long time. Wall Street loves the fees that deal-making generates, and the press loves the stories that colorful promoters provide. At a point, also, the soaring price of a promotedstockcanitselfbecomethe“proof”thatanillusionisreality. Eventually,ofcourse,thepartyends,andmanybusiness“emperors”arefoundtohavenoclothes.Financial history is replete with the names of famous conglomerateurs who were initially lionized as business geniuses by journalists,analystsandinvestmentbankers,butwhosecreationsendedupasbusinessjunkyards.

For those reasons, our conglomerate will remain a collection of controlled and non-controlled businesses. Charlieand Iwillsimplydeployyourcapitalintowhateverwebelievemakesthemostsense,basedonacompany’s durablecompetitivestrengths,thecapabilitiesandcharacterofitsmanagement,andprice. If that strategy requires little or noeffort onourpart,somuchthebetter. Incontrast tothescoring system utilized in diving competitions, you are awarded no points in business endeavors for “degree of difficulty.” Furthermore, as Ronald Reagan cautioned: “It’s said that hard work never killed anyone, but I say why take the chance?” The Family Jewelsand How We Increase Your Shareof These Gems On page A-1 we list Berkshire’s subsidiaries, a smorgasbord of businesses employing 360,000 at yearend. Youcanreadmuchmoreaboutthesecontrolledoperationsinthe10-Kthatfillsthebackpartofthisreport.Ourmajor positions in companies that we partly own and don’t control are listed on page 7 of this letter. That portfolio of businesses,too,islargeanddiverse. Mostof Berkshire’s value,however,resides infourbusinesses,threecontrolled andoneinwhichwehave onlya5.4%interest.Allfourarejewels. The largest in value is our property/casualty insurance operation, which for 53 years has been the core of Berkshire. Our family of insurers is unique in the insurance field. So, too, is its manager, Ajit Jain, who joined Berkshirein1986. Overall, the insurance fleet operates with far more capital than is deployed by any of its competitors worldwide. That financial strength, coupled with the huge flow of cash Berkshire annually receives from its non-insurancebusinesses,allowsourinsurancecompaniestosafelyfollowanequity-heavyinvestmentstrategynot feasiblefortheoverwhelmingmajorityofinsurers.Thosecompetitors,forbothregulatoryandcredit-ratingreasons, mustfocusonbonds. And bonds are not the place to be these days. Can you believe that the income recently available from a 10-year U.S. Treasury bond – the yield was 0.93% at yearend – had fallen 94% from the 15.8% yield available in September1981?Incertainlargeandimportantcountries,suchas Germanyand Japan,investorsearnanegativereturn on trillions of dollars of sovereign debt.

Someinsurers,aswellasotherbondinvestors,maytrytojuicethepatheticreturnsnowavailablebyshifting their purchases to obligations backed by shaky borrowers. Risky loans, however, are not the answer to inadequate interest rates. Three decades ago, the once-mighty savings and loan industry destroyed itself, partly by ignoring that maxim. Berkshirenowenjoys$138billionofinsurance“float”–fundsthatdonotbelongtous,butarenevertheless ours to deploy, whether in bonds, stocks or cash equivalents such as U.S. Treasury bills. Float has some similarities to bank deposits: cash flows in and out daily to insurers, with the total they hold changing very little. The massive sum held by Berkshire is likely to remain near its present level for many years and, on a cumulative basis, has been costlesstous.Thathappyresult,ofcourse,couldchange–but,overtime,Ilikeourodds. I have repetitiously – some might say endlessly – explained our insurance operation in my annual letters to you.Therefore,Iwillthisyearasknewshareholderswhowishtolearnmoreaboutourinsurancebusinessand“float” to read the pertinent section of the 2019 report, reprinted on page A-2. It’s important that you understand the risks, aswellastheopportunities,existinginourinsuranceactivities. Our second and third most valuable assets – it’s pretty much a toss-up at this point – are Berkshire’s 100% ownershipof BNSF, America’s largest railroadmeasuredbyfreight volume, andour 5.4% ownershipof Apple.And inthefourthspotisour91%ownershipof Berkshire Hathaway Energy(“BHE”).Whatwehavehereisaveryunusual utilitybusiness,whoseannualearningshavegrownfrom$122millionto$3.4billionduringour21yearsofownership.

On its balance sheet, Berkshire carries the Kraft Heinz holding at a GAAP figure of $13.3 billion, an amount that represents Berkshire’s share of the audited net worth of Kraft Heinz on December 31, 2020.

Let’s focus on two communities that provide stunning illustrations of thetalentandambitionexistingthroughoutourcountry. Youwillnotbesurprisedthat Ibeginwith Omaha. In1940,Jack Ringwalt, a graduate of Omaha’s Central High School(thealmamateraswellof Charlie,my dad,my first wife,our three childrenandtwograndchildren),decidedtostartaproperty/casualtyinsurancecompany fundedby$125,000incapital. Jack’s dream was preposterous, requiring his pipsqueak operation – somewhat pompously christened as National Indemnity – to compete with giant insurers, all of which operated with abundant capital. Additionally, those competitors were solidly entrenched with nationwide networks of well-funded and long-established local agents. Under Jack’s plan, National Indemnity, unlike GEICO, would itself use whatever agencies deigned to accept it and consequently enjoy no cost advantage in its acquisition of business. To overcome those formidable handicaps, National Indemnityfocusedon“odd-ball”risks,whichweredeemedunimportantbythe“bigboys.”And,improbably, thestrategysucceeded.

Beyond that, we retain our constitutional aspiration of becoming “a more perfect union.” Progress on that fronthasbeenslow,unevenandoftendiscouraging.Wehave,however,movedforwardandwillcontinuetodoso. Ourunwaveringconclusion:Neverbetagainst America. The Berkshire Partnership Berkshire is a Delaware corporation, and our directors must follow the state’s laws. Among them is a requirement that board members must act in the best interest of the corporation and its stockholders. Our directors embracethatdoctrine.

None of these groups, however, have a vote in determining such matters as dividends, strategic direction, CEOselection, or acquisitions and divestitures. Responsibilities like those fall solely on Berkshire’s directors, who mustfaithfullyrepresentthelong-terminterestsofthecorporationanditsowners. Beyond legal requirements, Charlie and I feel a special obligation to the many individual shareholders of Berkshire. A bit of personal history may help you to understand our unusual attachment and how it shapes our behavior.   Beforemy Berkshireyears,Imanagedmoneyformanyindividualsthroughaseriesofpartnerships,thefirst three of those formed in 1956. As time passed, the use of multiple entities became unwieldy and, in 1962, we amalgamated12partnershipsintoasingleunit,Buffett Partnership Ltd.(“BPL”). Bythatyear,virtuallyallofmyownmoney,andthatofmywifeaswell,hadbecomeinvestedalongsidethe fundsofmymanylimitedpartners.Ireceivednosalaryorfees.Instead,asthegeneralpartner,Iwascompensatedby my limited partners only after they secured returns above an annual threshold of 6%. If returns failed to meet that level, the shortfall was to be carried forward against my share of future profits. (Fortunately, that never happened: Partnership returns always exceeded the 6% “bogey.”) As the years went by, a large part of the resources of my parents,siblings,aunts,uncles,cousinsandin-lawsbecameinvestedinthepartnership. Charlie formed his partnership in 1962 and operated much as I did. Neither of us had any institutional investors, and very few of our partners were financially sophisticated. The people who joined our ventures simply trustedustotreattheirmoneyaswetreatedourown.Theseindividuals–eitherintuitivelyorbyrelyingontheadvice of friends – correctly concluded that Charlie and I had an extreme aversion to permanent loss of capital and that we wouldnothaveacceptedtheirmoneyunlessweexpectedtodoreasonablywellwithit.

Later still, in 1969, wedecidedtodissolve BPL.Afteryearend,thepartnershipdistributed,pro-rata,allofitscashalongwiththreestocks, thelargestbyvaluebeing BPL’s70.5%interestin Berkshire.

Our fourth bucket consists of individual shareholders who operate in a manner similar to the active institutionalmanagers I’vejustdescribed.Theseowners,understandably,thinkoftheir Berkshiresharesasapossible source of funds when they see another investment that excites them. We have no quarrel with that attitude, which is similartothewaywelookatsomeoftheequitiesweownat Berkshire. All of that said, Charlie and I would be less than human if we did not feel a special kinship with our fifth bucket: the million-plus individual investors who simply trust us to represent their interests, whatever the future may bring. They have joined us with no intent to leave, adopting a mindset similar to that held by our original partners.

In 1958, Phil Fisher wrote a superb book on investing. In it, he analogized running a public company to managing a restaurant. If you are seeking diners, he said, you can attract a clientele and prosper featuring either hamburgers served with a Coke or a French cuisine accompanied by exotic wines.But youmust not,Fisher warned, capriciouslyswitchfromonetotheother:Yourmessagetopotentialcustomersmustbeconsistentwithwhattheywill finduponenteringyourpremises.

Many of those investors, I should add, will do quite well.

ABerkshire Numberthat May Surprise You Recently, I learned a fact about our company that I had never suspected: Berkshire owns American-based property, plant and equipment –the sortof assets thatmake upthe “business infrastructure” of our country –witha GAAP valuation exceeding the amount owned by any other U.S. company. Berkshire’s depreciated cost of these domestic“fixedassets”is$154billion.Nextinlineonthislistis AT&T,withproperty,plantandequipmentof$127 billion.

Asset-heavy companies, however, can be good investments.

Thehistoryof Americanrailroadsisfascinating.After150yearsorsooffrenziedconstruction,skullduggery, overbuilding, bankruptcies, reorganizations and mergers, the railroad industry finally emerged a few decades ago as matureandrationalized. BNSF began operations in 1850 with a 12-mile line in northeastern Illinois. Today, it has 390 antecedents whose railroads have been purchased or merged. The company’s extensive lineage is laid out at http://www.bnsf.com/bnsf-resources/pdf/about-bnsf/History_and_Legacy.pdf. Berkshire acquired BNSF early in 2010. Since our purchase, the railroad has invested $41 billion in fixed assets,anoutlay$20billioninexcessofitsdepreciationcharges.Railroadingisanoutdoorsport,featuringmile-long trains obliged to reliably operate in both extreme cold and heat, as they all the while encounter every form of terrain fromdesertstomountains.Massivefloodingperiodicallyoccurs.BNSFowns23,000milesoftrack,spreadthroughout 28states,andmustspendwhateverittakestomaximizesafetyandservicethroughoutitsvastsystem. Nevertheless, BNSFhaspaidsubstantialdividendsto Berkshire–$41.8billionintotal.Therailroadpaysus, however, only what remains after it both fulfills the needs of its business and maintains a cash balance of about $2 billion. This conservative policy allows BNSF to borrow at low rates, independent of any guarantee of its debt by Berkshire.

Within a month, the schedulewasjunked. Our home office group, led by Melissa Shapiro and Marc Hamburg, Berkshire’s CFO, quickly regrouped. Miraculously,their improvisations worked.Greg Abel,one of Berkshire’s Vice Chairmen,joined me on stagefacing a dark arena, 18,000 empty seats and a camera.
