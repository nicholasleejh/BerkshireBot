BERKSHIREHATHAWAYINC. Tothe Shareholdersof Berkshire Hathaway Inc.: The per-share book value of both our Class A and Class B stock increased by 13% in 2010. Over the last46years(thatis,sincepresentmanagementtookover),bookvaluehasgrownfrom$19to$95,453,arateof 20.2%compoundedannually.* Thehighlight of 2010 wasour acquisition of Burlington Northern Santa Fe,apurchase that’s working out even better than I expected. It now appears that owning this railroad will increase Berkshire’s “normal” earning power by nearly 40% pre-tax and by well over 30% after-tax. Making this purchase increased our share count by 6% and used $22 billion of cash. Since we’ve quickly replenished the cash, the economics of this transactionhaveturnedoutverywell. A “normal year,” of course, is not something that either Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman of Berkshire andmypartner,or Icandefinewithanythinglikeprecision.Butforthepurposeofestimatingourcurrentearning power, we are envisioning a year free of a mega-catastrophe in insurance and possessing a general business climate somewhat better than that of 2010 but weaker than that of 2005 or 2006. Using these assumptions, and severalothersthat Iwillexplaininthe“Investment”section,Icanestimatethatthenormalearningpowerofthe assets we currently own is about $17 billion pre-tax and $12 billion after-tax, excluding any capital gains or losses.Everyday Charlieand Ithinkabouthowwecanbuildonthisbase. Both of us are enthusiastic about BNSF’s future because railroads have major cost and environmental advantages over trucking, their main competitor. Last year BNSF moved each ton of freight it carried a record 500 miles on a single gallon of diesel fuel. That’s three times more fuel-efficient than trucking is, which means ourrailroadownsanimportantadvantageinoperatingcosts.Concurrently,ourcountrygainsbecauseofreduced greenhouseemissionsandamuchsmallerneedforimportedoil.Whentraffictravelsbyrail,societybenefits. Over time, the movement of goods in the United States will increase, and BNSF should get its full share of the gain. The railroad will need to invest massively to bring about this growth, but no one is better situated than Berkshire to supply the funds required. However slow the economy, or chaotic the markets, our checkswillclear. Lastyear–inthefaceofwidespreadpessimismaboutoureconomy–wedemonstratedourenthusiasm for capital investment at Berkshire by spending $6 billion on property and equipment. Of this amount, $5.4billion–or90%ofthetotal–wasspentinthe United States.Certainlyourbusinesseswillexpandabroadin the future, but an overwhelming part of their future investments will be at home. In 2011, we will set a new recordforcapitalspending–$8billion–andspendallofthe$2billionincreaseinthe United States. Money will always flow toward opportunity, and there is an abundance of that in America. Commentators today often talk of “great uncertainty.” But think back, for example, to December 6, 1941, October 18, 1987 and September 10, 2001. No matter how serene today may be, tomorrow is always uncertain. * All per-share figures used in this report apply to Berkshire’s A shares. Figures for the B shares are 1/1500thofthoseshownfor A.

Performance Charlie and I believe that those entrusted with handling the funds of others should establish performance goals at the onset of their stewardship. Lacking such standards, managements are tempted to shoot thearrowofperformanceandthenpaintthebull’s-eyearoundwhereveritlands. In Berkshire’s case, we long ago told you that our job is to increase per-share intrinsic value at a rate greaterthantheincrease(includingdividends)ofthe S&P500.Insomeyearswesucceed;inotherswefail.But, if we are unable over time to reach that goal, we have done nothing for our investors, who by themselves could haverealizedanequalorbetterresultbyowninganindexfund. The challenge, of course, is the calculation of intrinsic value. Present that task to Charlie and me separately,andyouwillgettwodifferentanswers.Precisionjustisn’tpossible. To eliminate subjectivity, we therefore use an understated proxy for intrinsic-value – book value – when measuring our performance. To be sure, some of our businesses are worth far more than their carrying value on our books. (Later in this report, we’ll present a case study.)

We will strive, however, for better-than-averageresultsandfeelitfairforyoutoholdustothatstandard. Yearly figures, it should be noted, are neither to be ignored nor viewed as all-important. The pace of the earth’s movement around the sun is not synchronized with the time required for either investment ideas or operating decisions to bear fruit. At GEICO, for example, we enthusiastically spent $900 million last year on advertising to obtain policyholders who deliver us no immediate profits. If we could spend twice that amount productively, we would happily do so though short-term results would be further penalized. Many large investmentsatourrailroadandutilityoperationsarealsomadewithaneyetopayoffswelldowntheroad. To provide you a longer-term perspective on performance, we present on the facing page the yearly figures from page 2 recast into a series of five-year periods. Overall, there are 42 of these periods, and they tell aninterestingstory.Onacomparativebasis,ourbestyearsendedintheearly1980s.Themarket’sgoldenperiod, however, came in the 17 following years, with Berkshire achieving stellar absolute returns even as our relative advantagenarrowed. After 1999, the market stalled (or have you already noticed that?). Consequently, the satisfactory performance relative to the S&P that Berkshire has achieved since then has delivered only moderate absolute results. Looking forward, we hope to average several points better than the S&P – though that result is, of course,farfromasurething.Ifwesucceedinthataim,wewillalmostcertainlyproducebetterrelativeresultsin badyearsforthestockmarketandsufferpoorerresultsinstrongmarkets.

Theothernotesonpage2alsoapplytothistable. Intrinsic Value–Todayand Tomorrow Though Berkshire’s intrinsic value cannot be precisely calculated, two of its three key pillars can be measured. Charlie and I rely heavily on these measurements when we make our own estimates of Berkshire’s value. Thefirst component of value is our investments: stocks, bonds and cashequivalents. Atyearendthese totaled$158billionatmarketvalue. Insurance float – money we temporarily hold in our insurance operations that does not belong to us – funds$66billionofourinvestments.Thisfloatis“free”aslongasinsuranceunderwritingbreakseven,meaning thatthepremiumswereceiveequalthelossesandexpensesweincur.Ofcourse,underwritingresultsarevolatile, swinging erratically between profits and losses. Over our entire history, though, we’ve been significantly profitable, and I also expect us to average breakeven results or better in the future. If we do that, all of our investments – those funded both by float and by retained earnings – can be viewed as an element of value for Berkshireshareholders. Berkshire’ssecondcomponentofvalueisearningsthatcomefromsourcesotherthaninvestmentsand insuranceunderwriting.Theseearningsaredeliveredbyour68non-insurancecompanies,itemizedonpage106. In Berkshire’s early years, we focused on the investment side. During the past two decades, however, we’ve increasingly emphasized the development of earnings from non-insurance businesses, a practice that will continue. The following tables illustrate this shift. In the first table, we present per-share investments at decade intervals beginning in 1970, three years after we entered the insurance business. We exclude those investments applicabletominorityinterests. Per-Share Compounded Annual Increase Yearend Investments Period in Per-Share Investments 1970   $ 66 1980   754 1970-1980 27.5% 1990   7,798 1980-1990 26.3% 2000   50,229 1990-2000 20.5% 2010   94,730 2000-2010 6.6% Though our compounded annual increase in per-share investments was a healthy 19.9% over the 40-year period, our rate of increase has slowed sharply as we have focused on using funds to buy operating businesses. The payoff from this shift is shown in the following table, which illustrates how earnings of our non-insurancebusinesseshaveincreased,againonaper-sharebasisandafterapplicableminorityinterests. Per-Share Compounded Annual Increasein Year Pre-Tax Earnings Period Per-Share Pre-Tax Earnings 1970   $ 2.87 1980   19.01 1970-1980 20.8% 1990   102.58 1980-1990 18.4% 2000   918.66 1990-2000 24.5% 2010   5,926.04 2000-2010 20.5% Forthefortyyears,ourcompoundedannualgaininpre-tax,non-insuranceearningspershareis21.0%. Duringthesameperiod,Berkshire’sstockpriceincreasedatarateof22.1%annually.Overtime,youcanexpect our stock price to move in rough tandem with Berkshire’s investments and earnings. Market price and intrinsic valueoftenfollowverydifferentpaths–sometimesforextendedperiods–buteventuallytheymeet. There is a third, more subjective, element to an intrinsic value calculation that can be either positive or negative: the efficacy with which retained earnings will be deployed in the future. We, as well as many other businesses,arelikelytoretainearningsoverthenextdecadethatwillequal,orevenexceed,thecapitalwepresently employ.Somecompanieswillturntheseretaineddollarsintofifty-centpieces,othersintotwo-dollarbills. This “what-will-they-do-with-the-money” factor must always be evaluated along with the “what-do-we-have-now” calculation in order for us, or anybody, to arrive at a sensible estimate of a company’s intrinsic value.That’sbecauseanoutside investor stands byhelplessly asmanagement reinvests hisshareofthe company’s earnings. If a CEO can be expected to do this job well, the reinvestment prospects add to the company’s current value; if the CEO’s talents or motives are suspect, today’s value must be discounted. The difference in outcome can be huge. A dollar of then-value in the hands of Sears Roebuck’s or Montgomery Ward’s CEOsinthelate1960shadafardifferentdestinythandidadollarentrustedto Sam Walton.   Charlieand Ihopethattheper-shareearningsofournon-insurancebusinessescontinuetoincreaseata decent rate. But the job gets tougher as the numbers get larger. We will need both good performance from our current businesses and more major acquisitions. We’re prepared. Our elephant gun has been reloaded, and my triggerfingerisitchy. Partially offsetting our anchor of size are several important advantages we have. First, we possess a cadre of truly skilled managers who have an unusual commitment to their own operations and to Berkshire. Many of our CEOs are independently wealthy and work only because they love what they do. They are volunteers, not mercenaries. Because no one can offer them a job they would enjoy more, they can’t be lured away. At Berkshire, managers can focus on running their businesses: They are not subjected to meetings at headquartersnorfinancingworriesnor Wall Streetharassment.Theysimplygetaletterfrommeeverytwoyears (it’sreproducedonpages104-105)andcallmewhentheywish.Andtheirwishesdodiffer:Therearemanagers towhom Ihavenottalkedinthelastyear,whilethereisonewithwhom Italkalmostdaily.Ourtrustisinpeople ratherthanprocess.A“hirewell,managelittle”codesuitsboththemandme.

Some use budgetsandareby-the-booktypes;othersoperatebytheseatoftheirpants.Ourteamresemblesabaseballsquad composedofall-starshavingvastlydifferentbattingstyles.Changesinourline-upareseldomrequired. Our second advantage relates to the allocation of the money our businesses earn. After meeting the needs of those businesses, we have very substantial sums left over. Most companies limit themselves to reinvestingfundswithintheindustryinwhichtheyhavebeenoperating.Thatoftenrestrictsthem,however,toa “universe” for capital allocation that is both tiny and quite inferior to what is available in the wider world.

At Berkshire we face no institutional restraints whenwedeploy capital. Charlie and I are limited only byourabilitytounderstandthelikelyfutureofapossibleacquisition.Ifweclearthathurdle–andfrequentlywe can’t–wearethenabletocompareanyoneopportunityagainstahostofothers. When I took control of Berkshire in 1965, I didn’t exploit this advantage. Berkshire was then only in textiles,whereithadinthepreviousdecadelostsignificantmoney.Thedumbestthing Icouldhavedonewasto pursue “opportunities” to improve and expand the existing textile operation – so for years that’s exactly what I did. And then, in a final burst of brilliance, I went out and bought another textile company. Aaaaaaargh! Eventually Icametomysenses,headingfirstintoinsuranceandthenintootherindustries. There is even a supplement to this world-is-our-oyster advantage: In addition to evaluating the attractionsofonebusinessagainstahostofothers,wealsomeasurebusinessesagainstopportunitiesavailablein marketable securities, a comparison most managements don’t make. Often, businesses are priced ridiculously highagainstwhatcanlikelybeearnedfrominvestmentsinstocksorbonds.Atsuchmoments,webuysecurities andbideourtime.

Our final advantage is the hard-to-duplicate culture that permeates Berkshire. And in businesses, culturecounts. To start with, the directors who represent you think and act like owners. They receive token compensation: no options, no restricted stock and, for that matter, virtually no cash. We do not provide them directors and officers liability insurance, a given at almost every other large public company. If they mess up withyourmoney,theywilllosetheirmoneyaswell.Leavingmyholdingsaside,directorsandtheirfamiliesown Berkshire shares worth more than $3 billion. Our directors, therefore, monitor Berkshire’s actions and results withkeeninterestandanowner’seye.Youand Iareluckytohavethemasstewards. This same owner-orientation prevails among our managers. In many cases, these are people whohave soughtout Berkshireasanacquirerforabusinessthattheyandtheirfamilieshavelongowned.Theycametous with an owner’s mindset, and we provide an environment that encourages them to retain it. Having managers wholovetheirbusinessesisnosmalladvantage. Cultures self-propagate. Winston Churchill once said, “You shape your houses and then they shape you.”Thatwisdomappliestobusinessesaswell.Bureaucratic proceduresbegetmorebureaucracy,andimperial corporate palaces induce imperious behavior. (As one wag put it, “You know you’re no longer CEO when you get in the back seat of your car and it doesn’t move.”) At Berkshire’s “World Headquarters” our annual rent is $270,212. Moreover, the home-office investment in furniture, art, Coke dispenser, lunch room, high-tech equipment – you name it – totals $301,363. As long as Charlie and I treat your money as if it were our own, Berkshire’smanagersarelikelytobecarefulwithitaswell.

GEICO Nowlet me tell youastory thatwillhelpyouunderstand howtheintrinsic valueofabusiness canfar exceeditsbookvalue.Relatingthistalealsogivesmeachancetorelivesomegreatmemories. Sixty years ago last month, GEICO entered my life, destined to shape it in a huge way. I was then a 20-year-old graduate student at Columbia, having elected to go there because my hero, Ben Graham, taught a once-a-weekclassattheschool. One day at the library, I checked out Ben’s entry in Who’s Who in America and found he was chairman of Government Employees Insurance Co. (now called GEICO). I knew nothing of insurance and had never heard of the company. The librarian, however, steered me to a large compendium of insurers and, after readingthepageon GEICO,Idecidedtovisitthecompany.Thefollowing Saturday,Iboardedanearlytrainfor Washington. Alas, when I arrived at the company’s headquarters, the building was closed. I then rather frantically startedpoundingonadoor,untilfinallyajanitorappeared.Iaskedhimiftherewasanyoneintheoffice Icould talkto,andhesteeredmetotheonlypersonaround,Lorimer Davidson. That was my lucky moment. During the next four hours, “Davy” gave me an education about both insurance and GEICO. It was the beginning of a wonderful friendship. Soon thereafter, I graduated from Columbiaandbecameastocksalesmanin Omaha.GEICO,ofcourse,wasmyprimerecommendation,whichgot me off to a great start with dozens of customers. GEICO also jump-started my net worth because, soon after meeting Davy,Imadethestock75%ofmy$9,800investmentportfolio.(Evenso,Ifeltover-diversified.) Subsequently,Davybecame CEOof GEICO,takingthecompanytoundreamed-ofheightsbeforeitgot into trouble in the mid-1970s, a few years after his retirement. When that happened – with the stock falling by more than 95% – Berkshire bought about one-third of the company in the market, a position that over the years increasedto50%becauseof GEICO’srepurchasesofitsownshares.Berkshire’scostforthishalfofthebusiness was$46million.(Despitethesizeofourposition,weexercisednocontroloveroperations.) Wethenpurchasedtheremaining50%of GEICOatthebeginningof1996,whichspurred Davy,at95, to make a video tape saying how happy he was that his beloved GEICO would permanently reside with Berkshire.(Healsoplayfullyconcludedwith,“Nexttime,Warren,pleasemakeanappointment.”) Alothashappenedat GEICOduringthelast60years,butitscoregoal–saving Americanssubstantial money on their purchase of auto insurance – remains unchanged.

The excess over tangible net worth of the implied value – $2.7 billion – was what we estimated GEICO’s“goodwill”tobeworthatthattime.Thatgoodwillrepresentedtheeconomicvalueofthepolicyholders who were then doing business with GEICO. In 1995, those customers had paid the company $2.8 billion in premiums. Consequently, we were valuing GEICO’s customers at about 97% (2.7/2.8) of what they were annually paying the company. By industry standards, that was a very high price. But GEICO was no ordinary insurer:Becauseofthecompany’slowcosts,itspolicyholderswereconsistentlyprofitableandunusuallyloyal. Today, premium volume is $14.3 billion and growing. Yet we carry the goodwill of GEICO on our books at only $1.4 billion, an amount that will remain unchanged no matter how much the value of GEICO increases.

Ioweanenormousdebtto Tonyand Davy(and,cometothinkofit,tothatjanitoraswell).   Now, let’s examine the four major sectors of Berkshire. Each has vastly different balance sheet and incomecharacteristicsfromtheothers.Lumpingthemtogetherthereforeimpedesanalysis.Sowe’llpresentthem asfourseparatebusinesses,whichishow Charlieand Iviewthem. We will look first at insurance, Berkshire’s core operation and the engine that has propelled our expansionovertheyears. Insurance Property-casualty (“P/C”) insurers receive premiums upfront and pay claims later. In extreme cases, such as those arising from certain workers’ compensation accidents, payments can stretch over decades. This collect-now, pay-later model leaves us holding large sums – money we call “float” – that will eventually go to others. Meanwhile, we get to invest this float for Berkshire’s benefit. Though individual policies and claims come and go, the amount of float we hold remains remarkably stable in relation to premium volume. Consequently, as our business grows, so does our float. And how we have grown: Just take a look at the followingtable: Float Yearend (in$millions) 1970   $ 39 1980   237 1990   1,632 2000   27,871 2010   65,832 Ifourpremiumsexceedthetotalofourexpensesandeventuallosses,weregisteranunderwritingprofit that adds to the investment income that our float produces. When such a profit occurs, we enjoy the use of free money–and,betteryet,getpaidforholdingit.Alas,thewishofallinsurerstoachievethishappyresultcreates intense competition, so vigorous in most years that it causes the P/C industry as a whole to operate at a significant underwriting loss. This loss, in effect, is what the industry pays to hold its float. For example, State Farm, by far the country’s largest insurer and a well-managed company, has incurred an underwriting loss in sevenofthelasttenyears.Duringthatperiod,itsaggregateunderwritinglosswasmorethan$20billion. At Berkshire, we have now operated at an underwriting profit for eight consecutive years, our total underwriting gain for the period having been $17 billion. I believe it likely that we will continue to underwrite profitably in most – though certainly not all – future years. If we accomplish that, our float will be better than cost-free.Wewillbenefitjustaswewouldifsomepartydeposited$66billionwithus,paidusafeeforholding itsmoneyandthenletusinvestitsfundsforourownbenefit. Let me emphasize again that cost-free float is not an outcome to be expected for the P/C industry as a whole: In most years, industry premiums have been inadequate to cover claims plus expenses. Consequently, the industry’s overall return ontangible equityhas for manydecades fallenfar short of the average returnrealizedby American industry, a sorry performance almost certain to continue.

A huge story in this sector’s year-to-year improvement occurred at Net Jets. I can’t overstate the breadth and importance of Dave Sokol’s achievements at this company, the leading provider of fractional ownershipofjetairplanes.

Despite this fee (which came to $38 million in 2010), Net Jets earned $207 million pre-tax in 2010, a swing of $918million from 2009.

Regulated,Capital-Intensive Businesses We have two very large businesses, BNSF and Mid American Energy, with important common characteristics that distinguish them from our many others. Consequently, we give them their own sector in this letterandsplitouttheirfinancialstatisticsinour GAAPbalancesheetandincomestatement. A key characteristic of both companies is the huge investment they have in very long-lived, regulated assets, with these funded by large amounts of long-term debt that is not guaranteed by Berkshire. Our credit is notneeded:Bothbusinesseshaveearningpowerthat,evenunderveryadversebusinessconditions,amplycovers their interest requirements. For example, in recessionary 2010 with BNSF’s car loadings far off peak levels, the company’sinterestcoveragewas6:1. Both companies are heavily regulated, and both will have a never-ending need to make major investments in plant and equipment. Both also need to provide efficient, customer-satisfying service to earn the respect of their communities and regulators. In return, both need to be assured that they will be allowed to earn reasonableearningsonfuturecapitalinvestments. Earlier I explained just how important railroads are to our country’s future. Rail moves 42% of America’sinter-cityfreight,measuredbyton-miles,and BNSFmovesmorethananyotherrailroad–about28% oftheindustrytotal.Alittlemathwilltellyouthatmorethan11%ofallinter-cityton-milesoffreightinthe U.S. istransportedby BNSF.Giventheshiftofpopulationtothe West,oursharemaywellinchhigher. All of this adds up to a huge responsibility. We are a major and essential part of the American economy’s circulatory system, obliged to constantly maintain and improve our 23,000miles of track along with its ancillary bridges, tunnels, engines and cars. In carrying out this job, we must anticipate society’s needs, not merely react to them. Fulfilling our societal obligation, we will regularly spend far more than our depreciation, with this excess amounting to $2 billion in 2011. I’m confident we will earn appropriate returns on our huge incrementalinvestments.Wiseregulationandwiseinvestmentaretwosidesofthesamecoin.

I’velosthalfmynetworth–and Istillhavemywife.”)Inthefuture,weexpectourmarketgainstoeventuallyat leastequaltheearningsourinvesteesretain.   In our earlier estimate of Berkshire’s normal earning power, we made three adjustments that relate to future investment income (but did not include anything for the undistributed earnings factor I have just described). The first adjustment was decidedly negative. Last year, we discussed five large fixed-income investments that have been contributing substantial sums to our reported earnings. One of these – our Swiss Re note – was redeemed in the early days of 2011, and two others – our Goldman Sachs and General Electric preferred stocks – are likely to be gone by yearend. General Electric is entitled to call our preferred in October andhasstateditsintentiontodoso.Goldman Sachshastherighttocallourpreferredon30daysnotice,buthas been held back by the Federal Reserve (bless it!), which unfortunately will likely give Goldman the green light beforelong. Allthreeofthecompaniesredeemingmustpayusapremiumtodoso–inaggregateabout$1.4billion– but all of the redemptions are nevertheless unwelcome. After they occur, our earning power will be significantly reduced.That’sthebadnews. There are two probable offsets. At yearend we held $38 billion of cash equivalents that have been earning a pittance throughout 2010. At some point, however, better rates will return. They will add at least $500million–andperhapsmuchmore–toourinvestmentincome.Thatsortofincreaseinmoney-marketyields is unlikely to come soon. It is appropriate, nevertheless, for us to include improved rates in an estimate of “normal” earning power. Even before higher rates come about, furthermore, we could get lucky and find an opportunity to use some of our cash hoard at decent returns. That day can’t come too soon for me: To update Aesop,agirlinaconvertibleisworthfiveinthephonebook. Inaddition,dividendsonourcurrentcommonstockholdingswillalmostcertainlyincrease.Thelargest gain is likely to come at Wells Fargo. The Federal Reserve, our friend in respect to Goldman Sachs, has frozen dividend levels at major banks, whether strong or weak, during the last two years. Wells Fargo, though consistentlyprosperingthroughouttheworstoftherecessionandcurrentlyenjoyingenormousfinancialstrength andearningpower,hasthereforebeenforcedtomaintainanartificiallylowpayout.(Wedon’tfaultthe Fed:For variousreasons,anacross-the-boardfreezemadesenseduringthecrisisanditsimmediateaftermath.) At some point, probably soon, the Fed’s restrictions will cease. Wells Fargo can then reinstate the rational dividend policy that its owners deserve. At that time, we would expect our annual dividends from just thisonesecuritytoincreasebyseveralhundredsofmillionsofdollarsannually. Othercompanies weholdarelikely toincreasetheirdividendsaswell.Coca-Colapaidus$88million in 1995, the year after we finished purchasing the stock. Every year since, Coke has increased its dividend.

By the end of that period, I wouldn’t be surprised to see our share of Coke’s annual earnings exceed 100% of what we paid for the investment. Time is the friend of the wonderful business.

When Charlie and I met Todd Combs, we knew he fit our requirements. Todd, as was the case with Lou, will be paid a salary plus a contingent payment based on his performance relative to the S&P. We have arrangements in place for deferrals and carryforwards that will prevent see-saw performance being met by undeservedpayments.Thehedge-fundworldhaswitnessedsometerriblebehaviorbygeneralpartnerswhohave receivedhugepayoutsontheupsideandwhothen,whenbadresultsoccurred,havewalkedawayrich,withtheir limited partners losingbacktheir earlier gains.Sometimes thesesamegeneral partners thereafter quicklystarted another fund so that they could immediately participate in future profits without having to overcome their past losses.Investorswhoputmoneywithsuchmanagersshouldbelabeledpatsies,notpartners.

His focus will be equities but he is not restricted to that form of investment. (Fund consultants like to require style boxes such as “long-short,” “macro,” “international equities.” At Berkshire our only style box is “smart.”) Overtime,wemayaddoneortwoinvestmentmanagersifwefindtherightindividuals.Shouldwedo that, we will probably have 80% of each manager’s performance compensation be dependent on his or her own portfolio and 20% on that of the other manager(s). We want a compensation system that pays off big for individualsuccessbutthatalsofosterscooperation,notcompetition. When Charlie and I are no longer around, our investment manager(s) will have responsibility for the entire portfolio in a manner then set by the CEO and Board of Directors. Because good investors bring a useful perspectivetothepurchaseofbusinesses,wewouldexpectthemtobeconsulted–butnottohaveavote–onthe wisdomofpossibleacquisitions.Intheend,ofcourse,the Boardwillmakethecallonanymajoracquisition. One footnote: When we issued a press release about Todd’s joining us, a number of commentators pointed out that he was “little-known” and expressed puzzlement that we didn’t seek a “big-name.” I wonder howmanyofthemwouldhaveknownof Louin1979,Ajitin1985,or,forthatmatter,Charliein1959.Ourgoal was to find a 2-year-old Secretariat, not a 10-year-old Seabiscuit. (Whoops – that may not be the smartest metaphorforan80-year-old CEOtouse.) Derivatives Two years ago, in the 2008 Annual Report, I told you that Berkshire was a party to 251 derivatives contracts(otherthanthoseusedforoperationsatoursubsidiaries,suchas Mid American,andthefewleftoverat Gen Re). Today,the comparable number is 203,a figure reflecting both a few additions toourportfolio andthe unwindingorexpirationofsomecontracts. Ourcontinuing positions, all ofwhich Iampersonallyresponsiblefor,falllargelyintotwocategories. Weviewbothcategories asengagingusininsurance-like activities inwhichwereceivepremiumsforassuming risks that others wish to shed. Indeed, the thought processes we employ in these derivatives transactions are identical to those we use in our insurance business. You should also understand that we get paid up-front when weenterintothecontractsandthereforerunnocounterpartyrisk.That’simportant. Ourfirst category of derivatives consists of a number ofcontracts, written in2004-2008,thatrequired payments by us if there were bond defaults by companies included in certain high-yield indices. With minor exceptions,wewereexposedtotheserisksforfiveyears,witheachcontractcovering100companies. In aggregate, we received premiums of $3.4 billion for these contracts. When I originally told you in our 2007 Annual Report about them, I said that I expected the contracts would deliver us an “underwriting profit,” meaning that our losses would be less than the premiums we received. In addition, I said we would benefitfromtheuseoffloat. Subsequently, as you know too well, we encountered both a financial panic and a severe recession. A number of the companies in the high-yield indices failed, which required us to pay losses of $2.5 billion. Today, however,ourexposureislargelybehindusbecausemostofourhigher-riskcontractshaveexpired.Consequently,it appearsalmostcertainthatwewillearnanunderwritingprofitasweoriginallyanticipated.Inaddition,wehavehad the use of interest-free float that averaged about $2 billion over the life of the contracts. In short, we charged the rightpremium,andthatprotecteduswhenbusinessconditionsturnedterriblethreeyearsago. Our other large derivatives position – whose contracts go by the name of “equity puts” – involves insurance we wrote for parties wishing to protect themselves against a possible decline in equity prices in the U.S.,U.K.,Europeand Japan.Thesecontractsaretiedtovariousequityindices,suchasthe S&P500inthe U.S. and the FTSE 100 in the U.K. In the 2004-2008 period, we received $4.8 billion of premiums for 47 of these contracts,mostofwhichranfor15years.Onthesecontracts,onlythepriceoftheindicesontheterminationdate counts:Nopaymentscanberequiredbeforethen. Asafirststepinupdatingyouaboutthesecontracts,Icanreportthatlatein2010,attheinstigationof our counterparty, we unwound eight contracts, all of them due between 2021 and 2028. We had originally received $647 million in premiums for these contracts, and the unwinding required us to pay $425 million. Consequently, we realized a gain of $222 million and also had the interest-free and unrestricted use of that $647millionforaboutthreeyears. Those 2010 transactions left us with 39 equity put contracts remaining on our books at yearend. On these,attheirinitiation,wereceivedpremiumsof$4.2billion. Thefutureofthesecontractsis,ofcourse,uncertain.Buthereisoneperspectiveonthem.Iftheprices oftherelevantindicesarethesameatthecontractexpirationdatesasthesepriceswereon December31,2010– and foreign exchange rates are unchanged – we would owe $3.8 billion on expirations occurring from 2018 to 2026.Youcancallthisamount“settlementvalue.” On our yearend balance sheet, however, we carry the liability for those remaining equity puts at $6.7billion.Inotherwords,ifthepricesoftherelevantindicesremainunchangedfromthatdate,wewillrecord a $2.9billion gain in the years to come, that being the difference between the liability figure of $6.7billion and thesettlementvalueof$3.8billion.Ibelievethatequitypriceswillverylikelyincreaseandthatourliabilitywill fall significantly between now and settlement date. If so, our gain from this point will be even greater. Butthat, ofcourse,isfarfromasurething.

Since money is fungible, think of a portion of these funds as contributing to the purchase of BNSF. As I have told you before, almost all of our derivatives contracts are free of any obligation to post collateral – a fact that cut the premiums we could otherwise have charged. But that fact also left us feeling comfortable during the financial crisis, allowing us in those days to commit to some advantageous purchases. Foregoingsomeadditionalderivativespremiumsprovedtobewellworthit. On Reportingand Misreporting:The Numbers That Countand Those That Don’t Earlierinthisletter,Ipointedoutsomenumbersthat Charlieand Ifindusefulinvaluing Berkshireand measuringitsprogress. Let’s focus here on a number we omitted, but which many in the media feature above all others: net income. Important thoughthat numbermaybeatmost companies, itisalmost alwaysmeaningless at Berkshire. Regardless of howour businesses might be doing, Charlie and I could–quitelegally –causenetincome inany givenperiodtobealmostanynumberwewouldlike. Wehavethatflexibility becauserealized gainsorlosses oninvestments gointothenetincomefigure, whereas unrealized gains (and, in most cases, losses) are excluded. For example, imagine that Berkshire had a $10billionincreaseinunrealizedgainsinagivenyearandconcurrentlyhad$1billionofrealizedlosses.Ournet income – which would count only the loss – would be reported as less than our operating income. If we had meanwhile realized gainsintheprevious year,headlinesmightproclaim thatourearningsweredown X%when inrealityourbusinessmightbemuchimproved. Ifwereallythoughtnetincomeimportant,wecouldregularlyfeedrealizedgainsintoitsimplybecause we have a huge amount of unrealized gains upon which to draw. Rest assured, though, that Charlie and I have neversoldasecuritybecauseoftheeffectasalewouldhaveonthenetincomeweweresoontoreport.Weboth haveadeepdisgustfor“gameplaying”withnumbers,apracticethatwasrampantthroughoutcorporate America inthe1990sandstillpersists,thoughitoccurslessfrequentlyandlessblatantlythanitusedto.

Both realized and unrealized gains and losses are fully reflected in the calculation of our book value. Pay attention to the changes in that metric and to the course of our operating earnings, and you will be on the righttrack.   Asap.s.,Ican’tresistpointingoutjusthowcapriciousreportednetincomecanbe.Hadourequityputs hadaterminationdateof June30,2010,wewouldhavebeenrequiredtopay$6.4billiontoourcounterpartiesat that date. Security prices then generally rose in the next quarter, a move that brought the corresponding figure down to $5.8 billion on September 30th. Yet the Black-Scholes formula that we use in valuing these contracts required us to increase our balance-sheet liability during this period from $8.9 billion to $9.6 billion, a change that,aftertheeffectoftaxaccruals,reducedournetincomeforthequarterby$455million. Both Charlie and I believe that Black-Scholes produces wildly inappropriate values when applied to long-dated options. We set out one absurd example in these pages two years ago. More tangibly, we put our money where our mouth was by entering into our equity put contracts. By doing so, we implicitly asserted that the Black-Scholescalculationsusedbyourcounterpartiesortheircustomerswerefaulty. Wecontinue,nevertheless, tousethatformulainpresentingourfinancial statements. Black-Scholesis the accepted standard for option valuation – almost all leading business schools teach it – and we would be accused of shoddy accounting if we deviated from it. Moreover, we would present our auditors with an insurmountable problem were we to do that: They have clients who are our counterparties and who use Black- Scholesvaluesforthesamecontractswehold.Itwouldbeimpossibleforourauditorstoattesttotheaccuracyof boththeirvaluesandourswerethetwofarapart. Part of the appeal of Black-Scholes to auditors and regulators is that it produces a precise number. Charlie and I can’t supply one of those. We believe the true liability of our contracts to be far lower than that calculated by Black-Scholes, but wecan’t come up with an exact figure –anymore thanwecancomeupwitha precise value for GEICO, BNSF, or for Berkshire Hathaway itself. Our inability to pinpoint a number doesn’t botherus:Wewouldratherbeapproximatelyrightthanpreciselywrong. John Kenneth Galbraith once slyly observed that economists were most economical with ideas: They made the ones learned in graduate school last a lifetime. University finance departments often behave similarly. Witness the tenacity with which almost all clung to the theory of efficient markets throughout the 1970s and 1980s, dismissively calling powerful facts that refuted it “anomalies.” (I always love explanations of that kind: The Flat Earth Society probably views a ship’s circling of the globe as an annoying, but inconsequential, anomaly.) Academics’currentpracticeofteaching Black-Scholesasrevealedtruthneedsre-examination.Forthat matter, so does the academic’s inclination to dwell on the valuation of options. You can be highly successful as an investor without having the slightest ability to value an option. What students should be learning is how to valueabusiness.That’swhatinvestingisallabout. Lifeand Debt The fundamental principle of auto racing is that to finish first, you must first finish. That dictum is equallyapplicabletobusinessandguidesoureveryactionat Berkshire. Unquestionably, some people have become very rich through the use of borrowed money. However, that’salsobeenawaytogetverypoor.Whenleverageworks,itmagnifiesyourgains.Yourspousethinksyou’re clever, and your neighbors get envious. But leverage is addictive.

I didn’t meet Charlie until he was 35, though he grew up within 100 yards of where I have lived for 52 years and also attended the same inner-city public high school in Omaha from which my father, wife, children and two grandchildrengraduated.Charlieand Idid,however,bothworkasyoungboysatmygrandfather’sgrocerystore, though our periods of employment were separated by about five years.

We agree with investment writer Ray De Voe’s observation, “More money has been lost reaching for yield than at the point of a gun.” At Berkshire, we don’t rely on bank lines, and we don’t enter into contracts that could require postings of collateral except for amounts that are tiny in relation to ourliquidassets. Furthermore, not a dime of cash has left Berkshire for dividends or share repurchases during the past 40 years. Instead, we have retained all of our earnings to strengthen our business, a reinforcement now running about $1billion permonth.Ournetworthhasthusincreased from $48million to$157billion duringthosefour decades and our intrinsic value has grown far more.

The best reason to exit, of course, is to shop. We will help you do that by filling the 194,300-square- foot hall that adjoins the meeting area with products from dozens of Berkshire subsidiaries. Last year, you did your part, and most locations racked up record sales. In a nine-hour period, we sold 1,053 pairs of Justin boots, 12,416 pounds of See’s candy, 8,000 Dairy Queen Blizzards® and 8,800 Quikut knives (that’s 16 knives per minute). Butyoucan dobetter.

We will again have the same three financial journalists lead the question-and-answer period, asking Charlie and me questions that shareholders have submitted to them by e-mail. The journalists and their e-mail addresses are: Carol Loomis, of Fortune, who may be emailed at cloomis@fortunemail.com; Becky Quick, of CNBC, at Berkshire Questions@cnbc.com, and Andrew Ross Sorkin, of The New York Times, at arsorkin@nytimes.com.

February26,2011 Warren E.Buffett Chairmanofthe Board Memo To: Berkshire Hathaway Managers (“The All-Stars”) cc: Berkshire Directors From: Warren E. Buffett Date: July26,2010 This is my biennial letter to reemphasize Berkshire’s top priority and to get your help on succession planning (yours,not mine!). The priority is that all of us continue to zealously guard Berkshire’s reputation. We can’t be perfect but we can try to be. As I’ve said in these memos for more than 25 years: “We can afford to lose money – even a lot of money. But we can’t afford to lose reputation – even a shred of reputation.” We must continue to measure every act against not only what is legal but also what we would be happy to have written about on the front page of a national newspaper in an article written byan unfriendly but intelligent reporter. Sometimes your associates will say “Everybody else is doing it.” This rationale is almost always a bad one if it is the main justification for a business action. It is totally unacceptable when evaluating a moral decision. Whenever somebody offers that phrase as a rationale, in effect they are saying that they can’t come up with a good reason. If anyone gives this explanation, tell them to try using it with a reporter ora judge and see howfar it gets them. If you see anything whose propriety or legality causes you to hesitate, be sure to give me a call. However, it’s very likely that if a given course of action evokes such hesitation, it’s too close to the line and should be abandoned. There’s plenty of money to be made in the center of the court. If it’s questionable whether some action isclose to the line, just assume it isoutside and forget it. As a corollary, let me know promptly if there’s any significant bad news. I can handle bad news but I don’t like to deal with it after it has festered for awhile. A reluctance to face up immediately to bad news is what turned a problem at Salomon from one that could have easily been disposed of into one that almost caused the demise ofa firm with 8,000employees. Somebody is doing something today at Berkshire that you and I would be unhappy about if we knew of it. That’s inevitable: We now employ more than 250,000 people and the chances of that number getting through the day without any bad behavior occurring is nil. But we can have a huge effect in minimizing such activities by jumping on anything immediately when there is the slightest odor of impropriety. Your attitude on such matters, expressed by behavior as well as words, will be the most important factor in how the culture of your business develops. Culture, more than rule books, determines howan organization behaves. In other respects, talk to me about what is going on as little or as much as you wish. Each of you does a first-class job of running your operation with your own individual style and you don’t need me to help. The only items you need to clear with me are any changes in post-retirement benefits and any unusually large capital expenditures oracquisitions.   I need your help in respect to the question of succession. I’m not looking for any of you to retire and I hope you all live to 100. (In Charlie’s case, 110.) But just in case you don’t, please send me a letter (at home if you wish) giving your recommendation as who should take over tomorrow if you should become incapacitated overnight. These letters will be seen by no one but me unless I’m no longer CEO, in which case my successor will need the information. Please summarize the strengths and weaknesses of your primary candidate as well as any possible alternates you may wish to include. Most of you have participated in this exercise in the past and others have offered your ideas verbally. However, it’s important to me to get a periodic update, and now that we have added so many businesses, I need to have your thoughts in writing rather than trying to carry them around in my memory. Of course, there are a few operations that are run by two or more of you – such as the Blumkins, the Merschmans, the pair at Applied Underwriters, etc. – and in these cases, just forget about this item. Your note can be short, informal, handwritten, etc. Justmark it “Personal for Warren.” Thanks for your help on all of this. And thanks for the way you run your businesses. You make my job easy. WEB/db P.S. Another minor request: Please turn down all proposals for me to speak, make contributions, intercede with the Gates Foundation, etc. Sometimes these requests for you to act as intermediary will be accompanied by “It can’t hurt to ask.” It will be easier for both of us if you just say “no.” As an added favor, don’t suggest that they instead write or call me. Multiply 76 businesses by the periodic “I think he’ll be interested in this one” and youcan understand whyit isbetter to saynofirmly and immediately.
